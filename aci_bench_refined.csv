The patient went for a walk yesterday and began to feel lightheaded. She started to fall, however she was with her boyfriend, who caught her. She presented to the emergency room after this. While in the emergency room, her blood pressure was nearly 200 and she had a headache.

Her blood pressure is typically normal, however will become elevated approximately one week a month. She notes it is typically elevated because she is traveling a lot that week for work. While traveling, she is not eating as well and does not monitor her blood pressure. The patient is taking her lisinopril as prescribed.

Regarding her depression, she states she is doing well. Last year she started therapy and she has been going once a week, which has helped. Her support system is great and includes her boyfriend, mom, and brother.

The patient notes she has a little bit of nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies. She denies chest pain and shortness of breath.

ASSESSMENT

Ms. Diane Baker is a 28-year-old female with a past medical history significant for depression, and hypertension, who presents for emergency room follow-up.

PLAN

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is not controlled at this time. The patient presented to the emergency department yesterday with an elevated blood pressure, presyncope, and headache. She has been compliant with lisinopril, but her blood pressures have been spiking once a month based on home monitoring; however, she admits to not taking her blood pressures while traveling recently. A recent EKG revealed changes from her chronic high blood pressure.
• Medical Treatment: Increase lisinopril to 40 mg once a day.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will continue to check her blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal. We will have to make adjustments if necessary.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well with weekly therapy.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current management strategies. No medication to start at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She can contact me if she needs anything.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:

Shortness of breath.
• Medical Reasoning: I reviewed the patient's chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, and labs which were all normal. He does have slight expiratory wheezing bilaterally on exam. I suspect his episode of shortness of breath was due to an exacerbation of asthma.
• Medical Treatment: I would like to prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath.
• Specialist Referral: I have referred him to pulmonology for an asthma workup.

Acid reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This seems stable.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended the patient continue Protonix.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: This problem is also stable. Continue on Imitrex as needed.
• Medical Treatment: I recommended he continue Imitrex as needed for migraines.

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills. Endorses weight loss. Endorses fatigue.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.
• Respiratory:   Endorses shortness of breath with seasonal changes.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena.
• Genitourinary: Denies abnormal bleeding between menses.
• Neurological: Positive for dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: Supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate. Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. No gallops or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Gastrointestinal: Tenderness to palpation to the right lower quadrant.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1c is 8.2.
Labs are within normal limits.
Anemia labs: Still pending.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Joyce Price is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD, congestive heart failure, who presents for follow up of abnormal labs.

1. Abnormal labs.
• Medical Reasoning: Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2. Her available anemia labs were normal, but we need to wait for her pending labs for a definitive anemia diagnosis.
• Additional Testing: I would like to obtain an endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
• Specialist Referrals: We will put in a referral to gastroenterology to perform her endoscopy and colonoscopy.

2. COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. She ceased tobacco use several years ago and continues to abstain from this.
• Medical Treatment: I do not think she needs any inhalers at this time. She should continue to stay away from smoking.

3. Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and continues to follow dietary modifications, particularly with limiting her sodium intake.
• Medical Treatment: Continue on Toprol and lisinopril, as well as her current dose of Lasix 20 mg a day.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up of abnormal lab finding (low hemoglobin).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD and congestive heart failure presents for follow-up of an abnormal lab finding (low hemoglobin). Patient reports significant fatigue and decreased energy over the past couple of months, worsening over the past month, which has impacted her ability to maintain her usual exercise routine (running, climbing 1-2 hours/day). She reports slight weight loss, which she attributes to increased exercise prior to the onset of severe fatigue. She denies blood in her stools, dark/charry/black stools, or increased spotting with periods. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath (except seasonal), fever, chills, or body aches.

Patient reports her COPD is stable; she quit smoking cold turkey several years ago and continues to abstain. She notes seasonal breathing difficulty which she attributes to allergies. Her congestive heart failure is stable; she reports adherence to a low-sodium diet, avoiding foods like french fries. She denies any leg swelling.

Patient reports having a good support system including her boyfriend and brother.

Her right carpal tunnel release was performed a couple of years ago and she is back to work. She has full range of motion and it feels really good. No numbness or tingling in her hands.

She has had prior stenting for her heart and heart vessels in the past. Over the last month, she reports chest pain approximately 3-4 times a week with ambulation. Her chest pain does resolve with rest. The pain is described as burning and is located in the middle of her chest. She denies pain at rest.

She has had a little bit of nasal congestion from allergies. The patient denies, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or lower extremity edema.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with some joint pain.

The patient reports he has been "" putting a few more miles on the bike each day "". His bilateral knees have been sore in the last 3 to 4 days. He states his bilateral knees are equally painful. He notes stiffness and soreness in the morning and, by the end of the day, he feels the same sensation. He endorses swelling and redness in his knees which reduces in severity by the afternoon. The patient denies any other associated fatigue. He denies any injury to his knees. He denies pain in any other joints including his elbows, wrists, or shoulders.

In regards to his coronary artery disease, Mr. Moore states he is compliant with his aspirin and Crestor. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

The patient denies recent symptoms related to his lupus over the last year.

He denies fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomitting.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and erythema in bilateral knees.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: Edema and slight erythema of bilateral knees. Slight effusion of the right knee with pain to palpation. Decreased range of motion in bilateral knees.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. No bony abnormalities or fractures were noted.

Electrocardiogram stable in comparison to last year.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with some joint pain.

Lupus.
• Medical Reasoning: This has been stable and asymptomatic for the past year, but the patient reports increased joint pain and inflammation in his bilateral knees lately. ​His recent knee x-ray was unremarkable, so I am concerned that this is a lupus flare.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.

Coronary artery disease.
• Medical Reasoning: He is asymptomatic at this time. He has discontinued Plavix but continues with daily aspirin and Crestor. His recent EKG was unremarkable.
• Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel and a repeat echocardiogram.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. James Moore is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and lupus, who presents today with bilateral knee pain. The pain has been present for the last 3 to 4 days. He reports the pain is equally severe in both knees. He describes the pain as stiffness and soreness, particularly noticeable upon waking in the morning and again by the end of the day, around dinner time. He notes his knees appear ""a little inflamed"" in the morning, which is less noticeable by the afternoon. The patient attributes the onset of pain to increasing his daily mileage on his bike as part of his workout routine, stating he ""probably doubled the miles."" He denies any specific injury preceding the pain. He denies pain in any other joints, including elbows, wrists, or shoulders. He denies associated symptoms such as fatigue or fever.

Patient reports compliance with his daily aspirin and Crestor for his coronary artery disease. He denies current chest pain or shortness of breath.
Patient reports no issues related to his lupus in the last year or so.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: Denies fever. Denies fatigue.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain. Denies shortness of breath.
Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.

RESULTS:
Right Knee X-ray: Reviewed, unremarkable. No bony abnormality or fracture noted.
Electrocardiogram (recent): Reviewed, noted as ""really good,"" no concerns from a heart standpoint.

A:
1. Bilateral Knee Pain, likely secondary to Lupus flare vs. overuse/inflammatory arthritis: 57-year-old male with history of lupus and recent increase in cycling activity presents with acute onset bilateral knee pain, stiffness, swelling, erythema, effusion (R knee), and decreased range of motion. Unremarkable knee x-ray rules out fracture or significant bony abnormality. Given the history of lupus and inflammatory signs on exam, a lupus flare is a concern, though overuse from increased activity is also a contributing factor.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: Stable. Patient reports compliance with aspirin and Crestor. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Recent EKG and vital signs are reassuring.

P:
1. Bilateral Knee Pain:
    - Order autoimmune panel to evaluate for lupus flare.
    - Discussed possibility of lupus flare vs. overuse injury.
    - (No specific treatment recommendations like RICE, NSAIDs, or activity modification were discussed in the transcript).
2. Coronary Artery Disease:
    - Continue current medication regimen (Aspirin, Crestor).
    - Order lipid panel.
    - Order repeat echocardiogram.
    - Discussed stability based on patient report, vitals, and EKG.
Follow-up: Patient to be checked out by the nurse. (No specific return visit or follow-up timeframe discussed in transcript)."

Follow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.

The patient’s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.

She confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.

The patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.

Ms. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.

She is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.

The patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension.
Hyperlipidemia.
Peripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Current tobacco smoker.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Metoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Amlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.
Atorvastatin tablet.
Metformin.
Glimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.

VITALS

Blood pressure 140/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
No rasping, wheezing.

Cardiovascular
Normal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.

Gastrointestinal
No nausea or vomiting.

Extremities
Bilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.
Sensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1C 9.9%.

ASSESSMENT

• Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Peripheral vascular disease.

PLAN

Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Increase glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don’t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.

Peripheral vascular disease
I counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.

Hypertension
Blood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.

Hyperlipidemia
I will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Follow-up for diabetes management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female presenting for follow-up of chronic medical conditions, primarily diabetes mellitus. Patient reports her most recent Hemoglobin A1C was 9.9, indicating poor glycemic control. She states she is currently taking glimepiride 2 mg daily and was instructed to increase the dose to 4 mg twice daily after her last visit, but she did not do so. She reports limited dietary changes, avoiding pasta and rarely eating bread (prefers wheat when she does), and drinks club soda/seltzer instead of regular soda. She denies headaches, dizziness, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or other GI symptoms. She reports a recent productive cough with clear sputum, which she attributes to congestion, and denies associated fever, chills, or shortness of breath. She notes a slower urinary stream, increased frequency during the day, and occasional nocturia, attributing these symptoms to age and evening fluid intake. She reports bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which limits her walking, but states she is walking as tolerated. She reports her vision is better after recent cataract surgery but is not happy with one lens. She confirms compliance with her blood pressure medications (metoprolol, lisinopril/HCTZ, amlodipine) and reports a home blood pressure reading of 116 a few weeks ago. She confirms compliance with atorvastatin for cholesterol. She continues to smoke cigarettes and is not ready to quit, although she agreed to think about it.

[patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
[doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
[patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
[doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
[doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?

[patient] yep , that's all correct .
[doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?
[patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .

Numbness and tingling of both hands.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

He currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.
• Eyes: Floaters.
• Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.
• Respiratory: Shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
• Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.
• Endocrine: Excessive hunger.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Pinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel’s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

Diagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up after EMG testing.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Numbness and tingling of both hands.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred for evaluation of numbness and tingling in both hands. Symptoms began a few weeks prior to presentation, approximately one year after he sustained bilateral wrist fractures in a motor vehicle accident in December 2019. He notes the symptoms became more noticeable after the wrists healed. The numbness and tingling are present in both hands, radiating from the middle and ring fingers up the forearm on the right, and from the pinky and ring fingers on the left. He states the right side is worse than the left, consistent with the more severe injury to the right wrist in the accident. He reports wearing a splint on the right wrist consistently and on the left wrist intermittently, stating the splint helps alleviate symptoms. Symptoms have worsened over the last month. He describes the sensation primarily as soreness, sometimes throbbing, and notes his hands feel weaker, especially with use. The tingling is more prominent when the hands hurt, and feels ""dull"" when the pain subsides. Symptoms occur throughout the day but are worse at night. He denies complete loss of sensation but feels his hands may be less sensitive than they should be. He also reports mild stiffness in his neck, noting he hit his head during the accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He was prescribed nerve pain medicine but reports he has not been taking it as directed.

**Past Medical History:** Hypertension, Anxiety, Prediabetes (controlled by diet), Bilateral wrist fractures (December 2019), Head contusion (December 2019).
**Past Surgical History:** Not discussed.
**Family History:** Not discussed.
**Social History:** Not discussed.

**Medications:**
Coreg (for hypertension)
Lexapro (for anxiety)
Nerve pain medicine (not taking as directed)

**Allergies:** Not discussed.

**Review of Systems:**
Constitutional: Fatigue, weight gain.
Eyes: Floaters.
Cardiovascular: Shortness of breath, leg swelling.
Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, bloating.
Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
Integumentary: Nail bed changes, dryness, itching.
Endocrine: Excessive hunger.
Remainder of review of systems negative as per patient confirmation.

O:
**Vitals:** Not discussed.
**Physical Exam:**
Neurologic:
Sensation: Pin prick sensation diminished in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right. Sensation decreased in the 4th and 5th fingers on the left.
Reflexes: 1+ and symmetric throughout, 2+ at the knees.
Toes: Downgoing bilaterally.
Tinel's Sign: Positive at both wrists and both elbows, eliciting a ""zing"" sensation radiating up the wrist and into the elbow bilaterally.
Rest of exam noted as normal by clinician, specific components not detailed in transcript.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Bilateral Carpal Tunnel Syndrome vs. Bilateral Cubital Tunnel Syndrome:** Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male presenting with bilateral hand numbness and tingling, radiating into the forearms, which began after bilateral wrist fractures. Subjective report of symptoms involving the middle/ring fingers on the right and pinky/ring fingers on the left, coupled with objective findings of diminished pin prick sensation in the 3rd/4th fingers right and decreased sensation in the 4th/5th fingers left, and positive Tinel's signs at both wrists and elbows, suggest nerve compression. The symptom presentation is more suggestive of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, potentially aggravated by the past trauma. Bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome is also considered in the differential diagnosis.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Bilateral Carpal/Cubital Tunnel Syndrome:**
    *   Diagnosis and potential etiologies (carpal vs cubital tunnel syndrome, relation to past trauma) discussed with the patient.
    *   Further testing indicated to precisely locate the site of nerve irritation.
    *   Order EMG test to measure nerve responsiveness.
    *   Patient instructed to continue wearing splints.
    *   **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up visit after EMG testing is complete to review results and determine further management.
    *   **Future Management (if still symptomatic):** Consider referral to Hand Clinic or Orthopedics for potential interventions such as injections or carpal tunnel release surgery."

Sensation is normal except pinprick sensation diminished in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right and the 4th and 5th fingers on the left. 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes are downgoing bilaterally. Tinel's sign positive at both wrists and both elbows.

RESULTS

CT brain with and without contrast, 02/05/2021
Impression: No metastatic disease. No acute intracranial abnormalities. I personally reviewed the report and images.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, question of bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

I discussed my impression with the patient. I will schedule her for EMG/NCV. If her symptoms do not resolve, we can consider Hand Clinic referral for possibly symptomatic injections or carpal tunnel release surgery, although she can also pursue these through her current orthopedist. I encouraged her to wear her splints.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return for EMG/NCV.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bilateral hand numbness and tingling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old female presenting for evaluation of bilateral hand numbness and tingling. Symptoms began in December after she sustained bilateral wrist fractures in a motor vehicle accident (MVA). The numbness and tingling have progressively worsened over the last month. She describes the sensation as numbness and tingling, sometimes throbbing pain, and overall weakness, especially with use. The symptoms are worse at night and come and go throughout the day. On the right, the tingling is noted from the middle and ring finger up to the forearm. On the left, it is more in the pinky and ring finger, not the middle. She reports her hands feel weaker when using them. When they hurt, the tingling becomes ""dull"". She wears a splint on the right wrist consistently and on the left intermittently; she feels the splints help. She notes the right wrist was in worse shape initially after the MVA. She denies complete loss of sensation but feels her hands may be less sensitive than they should be. She reports mild stiffness in her neck, noting she hit her head during the MVA and was diagnosed with a contusion. She was prescribed nerve pain medicine but has not been taking it as directed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), gout, hypertension, anxiety, GERD, pre-diabetes (diet controlled). Denies history of thyroid issues.

MEDICATIONS:
Carvedilol 25 mg PO BID
Lexapro 10 mg PO daily
Nerve pain medicine (not currently taking as prescribed)

ALLERGIES: Sulfa (causes rash)

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: Reports fatigue and weight gain.
Eyes: Reports floaters.
Cardiovascular: Reports shortness of breath and leg swelling.
Gastrointestinal: Reports excessive appetite and bloating.
Endocrine: Reports positive diabetes (pre-diabetes) and always hungry.
Skin: Reports nail bed trenches, dryness, itching.
Musculoskeletal: Reports gout and muscle pain.
Neurological: Reports paresthesia in bilateral hands.
HEENT: Reports mild neck stiffness.

[doctor] i'm dr. phillips . very nice to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] how can i help you today ?
[patient] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Acid reflux.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.

The patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.

Ms. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Anxiety.

Surgical
Surgery as an infant for “twisted intestines.”

Procedures
Possible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Works as a paralegal.

FAMILY HISTORY

Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

ALLERGIES

Seasonal environmental allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms:  Positive for loss of appetite.
• Gastrointestinal: Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress and anxiety.
• Allergic/Immunologic:  Positive for seasonal allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
There is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.

• GERD
• Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

PLAN

• I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.
• I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.
• I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.
• If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.
• The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.
• She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.
• Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.
• Schedule EGD.
• Call with any changes or problems.
• Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Acid reflux.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Michelle King is a 35-year-old female presenting for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux, referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott. She reports a history of acid reflux since approximately age 12, which has worsened over the past few years. She describes the sensation as burning in her chest and throat. She denies difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. She also denies unintentional weight loss but notes a poor appetite for the past two months, attributing it to significant work stress as a paralegal.

Her symptoms are exacerbated by stress and certain foods, including spicy foods, soda (carbonated beverages), citrus products, and tomato-based products, although she admits to still consuming these occasionally.

She has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately one year. She feels it provides some relief, noting some days are asymptomatic, but others are severely affected, particularly after eating certain foods. She previously tried omeprazole concurrently with ranitidine, which she felt helped. She denies having had an upper endoscopy (EGD) in the last 10 years, though she may have had one when she was younger.

**Past Medical History:** Anxiety, seasonal allergies.

**Past Surgical History:** Abdominal surgery as an infant (around one month old) for ""twisted intestines.""

**Family History:** Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer. Mother had acid reflux and took medication to coat the stomach lining.

**Social History:** Works as a paralegal. Reports significant work stress.

**Current Medications:** Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

**Allergies:** Seasonal environmental allergies (reaction not specified).

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Positive for poor appetite. Denies unintentional weight loss.
*   **HEENT:** Positive for burning sensation in throat.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Positive for burning sensation in chest (heartburn). Denies abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding.
*   **Psychiatric:** Positive for stress and anxiety.
*   **Allergic/Immunologic:** Positive for seasonal allergies.

O:
**Physical Exam:**
*   **General:** Normal per new patient template (details not specified in transcript).
*   **Abdomen:** Well-healed surgical scar noted.

**Vitals:** Not discussed in transcript.
**Labs/Imaging:** Not discussed in transcript.

A:
The patient is a 35-year-old female presenting with a several-year history of GERD, characterized by burning chest and throat pain, which has worsened recently and is poorly controlled despite omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. She identifies dietary triggers (spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, tomato products) and stress as exacerbating factors. Pertinent negatives include the absence of dysphagia, abdominal pain, GI bleeding symptoms, and unintentional weight loss, which are reassuring concerning alarm symptoms. Family history is notable for maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer and mother with acid reflux. Physical exam reveals a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

Based on the history of poorly controlled symptoms on high-dose PPI and family history, GERD is the primary diagnosis. An underlying functional etiology is also suspected given the symptom profile and reported stress/anxiety. The lack of alarm symptoms is reassuring, but the family history warrants further investigation.

**Problem List:**
1.  Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), poorly controlled on high-dose PPI.
2.  Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

P:
**GERD / Suspected Functional Etiology:**
*   **Medication:** Discontinue omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. Start Nexium (esomeprazole) 40 mg twice daily. Prescription sent to patient's pharmacy on file.
*   **Lifestyle/Dietary Modifications:** Patient educated on the importance of avoiding identified trigger foods (spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, tomato products) and managing stress, as these can exacerbate GERD symptoms even on PPI therapy. Patient is agreeable to improving adherence to dietary changes.
*   **Procedure:** Recommend Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate for potential causes of refractory GERD, including ulcers, erosions, or precancerous/cancerous conditions, and to obtain biopsies if indicated. Procedure risks were discussed, and the patient is agreeable and will schedule at checkout.
*   **Further Workup (Contingent):** If EGD is normal and symptoms persist despite trial of Nexium, consider trial of Protonix (pantoprazole) and obtaining a pH-impedance study to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and differentiate between functional heartburn and hypersensitivity.
*   **Follow-up:** Patient to follow up in clinic after the EGD to discuss results and assess response to medication and lifestyle changes.
*   **Instructions:** Patient instructed to call the office if symptoms change or worsen, or if any problems arise before the EGD or follow-up appointment."

[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .
[patient] thanks , you too .
[doctor] next line heading will be "" acute to chronic constipation "" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .
[doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be "" quadriplegia "" . um , next line and heading will be "" covid vaccine status "" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Transition of care visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.

The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.

The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.

Quadriplegia.

Chronic constipation.
Automatic dysreflexia.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

MiraLAX as needed by mouth.
Lactulose as needed by mouth.

ASSESSMENT

• Acute to chronic constipation.
• Quadriplegia.

PLAN

Acute to chronic constipation
She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.

COVID vaccine status
Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.

Labs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up regarding recent hospitalization for suspected UTI vs. constipation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Michelle King is a 39-year-old female with a history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury, presenting for follow-up after a hospitalization at District Regional Hospital from 06/29/2021 to 07/02/2021. She was admitted with increasing concerns for spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. She was evaluated in the emergency department due to labile blood pressure, headache, and vomiting. During that admission, she was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Concerns for urinary tract infection were raised, and she was treated with IV antibiotic therapy. Urine cultures were obtained and reviewed. She has a suprapubic catheter. She was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient reports feeling back to her normal self. She states she does not believe her hospitalization was due to a urinary tract infection, but rather severe constipation. She reports telling the ED team she was constipated, but they did not agree, although they did perform x-rays. She states she had minimal bowel movements while hospitalized and experienced a ""massive poop"" upon returning home, after which she felt ""much better."" She currently takes Miralax daily for constipation and uses Lactulose as a ""rescue type thing"" when she doesn't go, noting it takes about two days to work and can be ""brutal."" She reports she had not had a regular bowel movement for a while leading up to the hospitalization, despite her regimen. She denies any pain or discomfort today.

The patient is unvaccinated for COVID-19. She expresses concerns about unknown long-term side effects and reports hearing about ""vaccine injury."" She believes she is young and healthy enough to beat COVID-19, despite her limited respiratory status, and takes Vitamin C and multivitamins. She denies receiving the annual flu shot.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Quadriplegia
Spinal cord injury
Chronic constipation
Autonomic dysreflexia

MEDICATIONS:
Miralax daily by mouth
Lactulose as needed by mouth

ALLERGIES:
Not mentioned.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Denies pain or discomfort today. (Other general symptoms like fever, diaphoresis, lightheadedness reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
HEENT: Denies headache today. (Headache reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
Respiratory: Lungs clear on exam today. (Limited respiratory status mentioned by patient).
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or palpitations. (Labile blood pressure reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
Gastrointestinal: Reports chronic constipation managed with Miralax and Lactulose. (Vomiting reported in HPI related to hospitalization).
Neurological: Reports history of spasms (in HPI related to hospitalization).

O:
VITALS: Not recorded/discussed.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Other systems (HEENT, CV, Abdomen, Neuro, Extremities, Skin): Not performed/discussed.
REVIEW OF HISTORICAL DATA (from hospitalization 06/29-07/02/2021):
WBC: 23,000 (elevated).
Urine Culture: Not impressive.
Abdominal X-ray: Performed in ED (findings not discussed).

A:
1. Acute on chronic constipation vs. Autonomic Dysreflexia related to constipation.
    - Patient presents for follow-up after hospitalization for symptoms including labile blood pressure, headache, vomiting, and elevated WBC, initially suspected to be UTI but patient believes was secondary to severe constipation.
    - Patient reports significant improvement in symptoms after a large bowel movement post-discharge, supporting her hypothesis.
    - Review of historical data shows elevated WBC (23k) and unimpressive urine cultures during hospitalization, making UTI less likely the sole cause.
    - Discussion regarding potential link between severe constipation/inflammation and elevated WBC was held.
    - Patient maintains a regular bowel regimen with Miralax daily and Lactulose PRN.
2. Quadriplegia (Underlying condition contributing to autonomic dysreflexia and bowel dysfunction).
3. COVID-19 Vaccine Status - Discussion and Counseling.
    - Patient is unvaccinated due to concerns about long-term side effects and belief in personal resilience and supplements.
    - Counseling provided regarding increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection given quadriplegia status and the benefits of vaccination as the primary preventative measure.

P:
1. Acute on chronic constipation / Autonomic Dysreflexia:
    - Continue current bowel regimen (Miralax daily, Lactulose PRN) as patient feels it is generally effective.
    - Patient education provided regarding potential link between dehydration, heat, and exacerbation of constipation.
    - Order fasting labs including CBC and lipid panel to be drawn in 2-3 weeks.
    - Rationale: Repeat CBC to assess trend of WBC towards normalization; lipid panel due for routine screening.
2. Quadriplegia:
    - Continue management as per patient's established care.
3. COVID-19 Vaccine Status:
    - Patient counseled on risks of COVID-19 infection given quadriplegia and benefits of vaccination.
    - Patient advised to consider vaccination as the most effective preventative measure.
    - Patient understands decision is personal.
4. Follow-up:
    - Return to clinic in 2-3 weeks for follow-up visit after labs are drawn to review results and reassess symptoms."

virtscribe,D2N185,"[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .
[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
[patient] yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] we automatically thought appendix .
[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .

Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Next patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

The father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had ""a lot of infections"". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.

Prior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.

When the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.

The patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.

FAMILY HISTORY

Paternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.
Paternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.

No family history of polycystic kidney disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Pepcid 40 mg once daily.
Claritin as needed for allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Well-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.

Neurological
Alert.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.
CT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.
CMP, 03/22/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Renal hypoplasia.
Ashley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.

PLAN

Yearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.

The patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

**History of Present Illness:** Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, presenting for evaluation of an abnormal renal ultrasound revealing an atrophic right kidney. Approximately [Duration not specified in transcript] ago, Ashley experienced sudden onset, severe right-sided abdominal pain, described as so bad she was bent over. She was initially evaluated and treated for a stomach virus with fluids, but symptoms worsened the following day. A repeat evaluation included an ultrasound which identified the kidney abnormality (right kidney atrophic/smaller, left kidney larger/hypertrophied). She continued to experience significant pain and vomiting and was seen at multiple facilities, including one in Jacksonville where she was told the right kidney was likely not working and described as atrophic. Further imaging reportedly found cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations, swollen lymph nodes, and signs of infection. After traveling to Atlanta and receiving treatment over four days, her acute symptoms improved, and she has had no vomiting since. However, she continues to complain of significant stomach pain and burning, especially when eating. She also reports urinary hesitancy, sometimes finding it hard to start urination, and occasional burning with urination (dysuria), particularly after drinking certain beverages like soda. She denies blood in her urine.

The family reports that prior to this acute illness, Ashley was generally healthy. They were told that a severe infection at some point may have affected her kidney. They recall that at age 4, Ashley was hospitalized 3-4 times over a couple of months for recurrent fevers and symptoms, treated with fluids and antibiotics without a specific workup for the source of infection. Symptoms would recur 1-2 weeks after discharge, then spontaneously resolved. The current doctor suspects her kidney issues may date back to this period.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Recurrent fevers/illnesses requiring hospitalization at age 4.
*   Previously healthy prior to current acute illness.

**Family History:**
*   Paternal Grandfather: Died at 47 of massive heart attack while on dialysis. History of Posterior Urethral Valves, obstructive neuropathy, End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease, dialysis-dependent, failed renal transplant.
*   Paternal Great Aunt (Paternal Grandmother's sister): End Stage Renal Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5, Diabetes, Hypertension (adult onset).
*   Maternal Grandmother: Breast Cancer.

**Social History:**
*   Active in softball.
*   Interested in joining drill team.
*   Generally eats a healthy diet.

**Review of Systems:**
*   General: Reports feeling ""not too bad"" currently.
*   Gastrointestinal: Persistent stomach pain and burning, especially with eating. Vomiting resolved since treatment in Atlanta.
*   Genitourinary: Urinary hesitancy, occasional dysuria (burning with urination), particularly with certain drinks (soda). Denies hematuria.
*   Other systems not specifically reviewed in detail in transcript.

**Current Medications:**
*   Pepcid 40 mg daily
*   Claritin PRN for allergies

**Allergies:** Not mentioned in transcript.

O:
**Physical Exam:**
*   Constitutional: Well-appearing female adolescent, alert and oriented, sitting comfortably, in no acute distress.
*   Cardiovascular: Heart sounds normal on auscultation.
*   Respiratory: Lungs clear on auscultation.
*   Other systems: Within normal limits (as stated by clinician).

**Vital Signs:** Not explicitly stated with values in transcript. Blood pressure noted by clinician as looking ""good"".

**Laboratory and Imaging Results (Discussed in transcript):**
*   Renal Ultrasound: Abnormal, showing atrophic right kidney and hypertrophic left kidney.
*   CT Abdomen and Pelvis: Mentioned as performed.
*   Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Mentioned as performed. Results discussed: Kidney function looks good, Creatinine 0.62, estimated GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m², normal serum electrolytes and acid base status.
*   Urinalysis: Mentioned as performed. Results discussed: Without sediment (implied normal).
*   Genetic Panel: Performed by geneticist. Results discussed: No clinically significant mutations found.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Right Renal Hypoplasia/Atrophy with Left Compensatory Hypertrophy:** 14-year-old female with known structural kidney abnormality discovered during evaluation for acute abdominal pain. Imaging confirms a small, atrophic right kidney and compensatory hypertrophy of the left kidney. The etiology is suspected to be related to a severe infection experienced in early childhood, based on history of recurrent hospitalizations at age 4. Currently, kidney function (Cr, GFR, electrolytes, acid base) and blood pressure are normal, and urinalysis is unremarkable. Genetic workup was negative for significant mutations. Patient is identified as being at higher risk for developing hypertension and proteinuria in the future.
2.  **Persistent Abdominal Pain, Burning, and Urinary Symptoms:** Patient reports ongoing stomach pain and burning, urinary hesitancy, and occasional dysuria despite resolution of acute vomiting. These symptoms persist following the acute illness that led to the discovery of the kidney abnormality. The burning with urination is noted to be exacerbated by certain drinks.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Right Renal Hypoplasia/Atrophy with Left Compensatory Hypertrophy:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Annual follow-up recommended including renal ultrasound to monitor kidney size and function, urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood, and blood pressure check.
    *   **Medication Management:** Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; use Tylenol for pain/fever instead.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:**
        *   Hydration: Encourage staying well-hydrated, especially during sports activities, aiming for at least 2 liters of water per day to avoid dehydration which can strain the kidneys.
        *   Diet/Activity: Continue healthy diet and active lifestyle to support overall health and potentially mitigate future kidney risks.
2.  **Persistent Abdominal Pain, Burning, and Urinary Symptoms:**
    *   Continue encouraging adequate hydration, particularly with water, avoiding beverages that exacerbate symptoms (e.g., soda).
    *   Patient and family instructed to call if symptoms worsen or if new questions arise.
3.  **Follow-up:** Patient does not require follow-up with pediatric nephrology at this time. Annual follow-up can be arranged with her primary care physician or a local adult nephrologist closer to home."

Low back pain, left side.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Phillips is a pleasant 35-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain.

The patient has been experiencing pain in the left side of his low back, generally localized around the surgical site of his microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020, but occasionally into the right side as well. Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.

ASSESSMENT

Low back pain, left side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.","S:

aci,D2N187,"[doctor] well good morning emily how are you
[patient] good morning
[doctor] how are you doing
[patient] doing okay i'm okay
[doctor] i understand you're having some sudden visual distortions and some blurring of your vision is that right
[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay so what's going on
[patient] sorry to put you off i do n't think i have that script
[doctor] oh

[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[doctor] that sounds really nice very good
[patient] it's just
[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions

Right eye: The cornea is clear. No MVI. PCIOL cup to disc is 0.2. Fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached 360 degrees without any tears or holes. RPE changes in the fovea. Posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula, thickening of the retina, presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation. Positive for hemorrhage.
Left eye: The cornea is clear. No MVI. Cup to disc is 0.3. RPE changes in the fovea. No hemorrhage or subretinal fluid. Retina is attached.

RESULTS

Optical coherence tomography shows drusen deposit. Retinal pigment epithelium with subretinal fluid accumulation. The choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized. Fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on her diagnostic testing and eye exam, this is at an advanced stage.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of the condition, as well as the recommendation for Lucentis injections. I explained the procedure in detail and advised the patient of the potential outcomes.
- Medical Treatment: We will proceed with a once-monthly Lucenti's injections.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sudden visual distortions and blurring.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is presenting with sudden onset of visual distortions and blurring of vision. She reports that straight lines and door frames have been looking crooked. She also notes difficulty adjusting to dim lights, particularly when going out to restaurants. These symptoms affect her ability to read and see straight lines.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Not specified in transcript.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Not specified in transcript.

FAMILY HISTORY: Not specified in transcript.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient reports smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes per day. She states she tries to stop but finds it difficult. She also mentions difficulty remembering to take her blood pressure medication regularly.

MEDICATIONS: Not specified in transcript.

ALLERGIES: Not specified in transcript.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Reports difficulty remembering to take blood pressure medication.
Eyes: Reports sudden visual distortions, blurring, crooked lines, and difficulty adjusting to dim lights.
Cardiovascular: Reports difficulty remembering to take blood pressure medication.
Respiratory: Reports smoking one pack of cigarettes per day.

O:
VITAL SIGNS: Not specified in transcript.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Eyes:
Anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PCIOLs) in both eyes.
Right eye: Cornea is clear. No neovascularization of the iris (MVI). PCIOL present. Cup to disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus examination shows the retina is attached 360 degrees without any tears or holes. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes are noted in the fovea. Posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula, thickening of the retina, presence of subretinal fluid, exudates accumulation, and positive for hemorrhage.
Left eye: Cornea is clear. No MVI. Cup to disc ratio is 0.3. RPE changes are noted in the fovea. No hemorrhage or subretinal fluid. Retina is attached.

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS:
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Shows drusen deposit and retinal pigment epithelium with subretinal fluid accumulation. Choroidal neovascular membrane is visualized.
Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye, consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

A:
1. Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Wet AMD), Right Eye: Based on subjective report of sudden visual distortions, blurring, crooked lines, and difficulty with dim lights, correlated with objective findings on eye examination (drusen, retinal thickening, subretinal fluid, exudates, hemorrhage in the macula of the right eye) and diagnostic testing (OCT showing subretinal fluid and neovascular membrane, FA showing focal leakage in the right eye). This is indicative of advanced neovascular AMD, which occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the retina and leak fluid and blood, leading to severe vision loss.

P:
1. Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Wet AMD), Right Eye:
    - Medical Treatment: Proceed with Lucentis injection into the vitreous portion of the right eye. The eye will be numbed prior to injection.
    - Frequency: Injections will be given once a month.
    - Patient Education: Discussed the nature of neovascular AMD (wet AMD), explaining that abnormal blood vessels are growing and leaking fluid/blood, which causes the symptoms and can lead to a large blind spot and severe vision loss. Explained the rationale for Lucentis injections, the procedure details (intravitreous injection after numbing), and potential outcomes (may slow vision decline or stop further loss, but disease and vision loss may still progress despite treatment).
    - Patient Agreement: Patient understands and agrees with the recommended treatment plan.
    - Follow-up: Continue with regular monthly injections over a period of time."

Follow up.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports an myocardial infarction.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports stent placement in the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient is a fan of the Denver Nuggets basketball team. He also enjoys swimming.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Brilinta twice a day every 12 hours, aspirin 81 mg at night, Crestor 40 mg once a day, and Toprol 50 mg once a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath with exertion.
Skin: Denies redness or infection in the right wrist.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 127/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. No gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Right radial artery cardiac catheterization site is clean, dry, and intact. No hematoma. Palpable radial pulse.

RESULTS

The ejection fraction, obtained while he was hospitalized, was measured at approximately 50%, which is in the low normal range.

I reviewed the patient’s recent echocardiogram which demonstrates mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. His catheterization site is healing well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of continuing to take his medications to prevent the stent from clogging again and to reduce his chance of another heart attack. I encouraged him to limit his salt intake as an increased amount of sodium can affect the ejection fraction measurement of his heart function.
- Medical Treatment: The patient is taking a low-dose aspirin, and will continue taking it for life or until he is instructed to discontinue. Continue Brilinta for at least 1 year. Continue Crestor 40 mg once a day. Continue Toprol 50 mg once a day. The patient can resume swimming a few laps. He will enroll in cardiac rehab to gain confidence in returning to exercising and for dietary education and counseling. Liver function studies and lipid panel ordered. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be performed in 6 months.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 6 weeks to review his studies.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up visit after recent myocardial infarction and stent placement.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient is a follow-up approximately two weeks status post inferior myocardial infarction requiring stent placement in the right coronary artery via radial artery approach. Patient reports feeling ""okay"" and ""better than I did,"" but not yet ""perfect."" He has been taking it easy, doing very light work, and mostly sitting around and taking medications as instructed. He denies any chest pain since the stent was placed. He notes some soreness at the wrist site immediately after the procedure, but this has resolved and the site appears to be healing well without redness or signs of infection. He reports experiencing shortness of breath when going up and down stairs, but is otherwise limiting activity. He is adherent with all prescribed medications. He reports attempting to watch his diet, eating lots of vegetables and chicken without salt, but admits to having eaten pizza a few times on weekends.

**Past Medical History:** Inferior Myocardial Infarction (recent).
**Past Surgical History:** Stent placement, Right Coronary Artery (recent, via radial artery).

**Social History:** Reports being a fan of the Denver Nuggets basketball team. Enjoys swimming. Reports trying to watch salt intake in diet.

**Medications:**
Aspirin 81 mg PO nightly
Brilinta (Ticagrelor) PO twice a day every 12 hours
Crestor (Rosuvastatin) 40 mg PO once a day
Toprol (Metoprolol Tartrate) 50 mg PO once a day

**Vitals:**
Blood Pressure: 127/60

**Physical Exam:**
Neck: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Musculoskeletal: Right radial artery cardiac catheterization site is clean, dry, and intact. No hematoma. Palpable radial pulse present.

**Results:**
Ejection Fraction: Approximately 50% (low normal) from recent hospitalization.
Echocardiogram: Recent study shows mild mitral regurgitation.

A:
1. Inferior Myocardial Infarction, status post PCI with stent: Patient is approximately two weeks post-MI and stent placement, reporting improvement in overall feeling and resolution of chest pain since the procedure. He is adherent with medical therapy. He reports exertional shortness of breath which is being addressed with activity recommendations and planned cardiac rehab. The radial access site is healing well.
2. Mild Mitral Regurgitation: New finding identified on recent echocardiogram, likely contributing to the systolic murmur noted on exam. This is noted as a ""little floppy valve"" and will be monitored.

P:
1. Inferior Myocardial Infarction, status post PCI with stent:
    *   **Medications:** Continue current regimen: Aspirin 81mg PO daily (lifelong), Brilinta PO BID (for at least 1 year), Crestor 40mg PO QD, Toprol 50mg PO QD. Emphasized importance of medication adherence to prevent stent thrombosis and future events.
    *   **Activity:** Patient cleared to resume swimming, starting with a few laps.
    *   **Rehabilitation:** Enroll in Cardiac Rehabilitation for supervised exercise, confidence building, and dietary education/counseling.

[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good
[patient] did you get did you select you last night
[doctor] i did
[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful
[patient] are you serious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] rockets
[doctor] i live in dallas yes
[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls
[doctor] no no
[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] okay
[doctor] bye
[patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay
[doctor] yes sir
[patient] alright very good any questions at all
[doctor] no
[patient] okay so","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Beverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.

The patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in a Children's Hospital.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm, dry and intact
MSK: 
Examination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.
Examination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.

**Chief Complaint:** Right knee pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Beverly Howard is a 33-year-old female presenting for evaluation of right knee pain that began approximately two weeks ago after falling off a tandem bicycle and striking her right knee on a curb. She reports immediate soreness and took ibuprofen and treated a wound. The pain has persisted daily since the injury. She localizes the pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She reports occasional clicking with full extension and occasional instability with ambulation. Her pain is worst when walking up an incline. Ibuprofen helps temporarily, but the pain returns. She denies any prior issues with her right knee.

**Past Medical History:** Denies previous right knee issues.
**Past Surgical History:** Not discussed.
**Family History:** Not discussed.
**Social History:** Works as a baby rocker in a children's hospital. Enjoys walking her dog and swimming, but has not swum since the injury. Occasional swimmer. Does not play organized sports currently.

**Review of Systems:**
Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.
*Other systems not discussed.*

**Medications:** Ibuprofen (dose/frequency not specified, patient took it).
**Allergies:** Not discussed.

O:
**Vitals:** Not documented.

**Physical Exam:**
Right Knee:
Skin: Dime-sized abrasion, dry, appears approximately one week old, located over the medial patella. No scars.
Musculoskeletal: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa nontender. Epicondyle nontender. Popliteal space nontender. Posterior aspect soft, no pain reported. Lateral side nontender. Full extension with occasional clicking. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress testing reveals medial collateral ligament intact. Lateral collateral ligament intact. Laxity noted with posterior drawer testing, estimated as 1+ posterior drawer. Anterior drawer negative. Lachman test negative. Patella tracks fine, no crepitus. McMurray test negative (medial and lateral).
Left Knee:
Musculoskeletal: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress testing reveals medial collateral ligament intact. Lateral collateral ligament intact. Posterior drawer feels normal compared to the right.

**Imaging:**
Right Knee X-rays (4 views): Reviewed. Appear normal and healthy. Bone edges look good, no bone spurs or fractures seen. Kneecap tracking looks good. Joint space is preserved (cartilage visible). Both knees appear the same on X-ray. No obvious abnormalities noted.

A:
**Right knee pain** likely secondary to bicycle fall and impact injury.
Differential diagnoses include:
- **Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) sprain/injury:** Suspected based on mechanism of injury (impact causing tibia to shift posteriorly) and physical exam finding of 1+ posterior drawer laxity.
- Meniscus injury
- Chipped cartilage

X-rays rule out fracture or obvious bony abnormality. Clinical exam findings suggest possible ligamentous injury, specifically PCL, but internal derangement (meniscus, cartilage) cannot be ruled out without further imaging. Isolated PCL injuries often do not require surgery, but concurrent injuries might.

P:
**Right Knee Pain / Suspected PCL Injury:**
1.  **Imaging:** Obtain MRI of the right knee to further evaluate the posterior cruciate ligament, menisci, and articular cartilage to confirm diagnosis and assess for concurrent injuries.
2.  **Bracing:** Fit patient with a temporary brace today for support.
3.  **Physical Therapy:** Provide referral for formal physical therapy to work on range of motion and strengthening. Recommend starting with a couple visits, frequency to be determined based on patient progress and home exercise capabilities.
4.  **Pain/Swelling Management:**
    *   Apply ice packs to the right knee a few times per day.
    *   Continue ibuprofen up to three times per day if helpful.
    *   Prescribe an alternative prescription medication (twice daily dosing) to be called into the patient's pharmacy as an option for less frequent dosing. Patient can revert to ibuprofen if preferred.
5.  **Patient Education:** Discussed X-ray findings (no fracture). Explained suspicion of PCL injury and rationale for MRI. Discussed conservative treatment plan (brace, PT, pain control) and the possibility of surgery only if instability persists after several months of conservative management.
6.  **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to recheck progress after starting treatment and reviewing MRI results."

In regards to his diabetes, the patient will continue the 500 mg of metformin for now.

For his hypertension, the patient will continue the 2.5 mg of Norvasc.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Left arm pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Zachary Wood presents today reporting left arm pain that began yesterday upon waking. He denies any specific injury or unusual activity prior to onset, noting only a ""usual day of working around the house"" including mowing grass. He localizes the pain from his left elbow up to his neck, describing it as an achiness and heaviness. He has taken Motrin, which provided no relief. He also reports intermittent chest pain that started yesterday, which he states comes and goes and sometimes radiates up his neck. He notes the chest pain bothered him while mowing grass the other day. He denies any associated shortness of breath.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Hypertension
*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**Medications:**
*   Metformin 500 mg
*   Norvasc 2.5 mg

**Allergies:** No allergies mentioned.

**Review of Systems:**
*   General: Reports achiness, heaviness.
*   Cardiovascular: Reports intermittent chest pain radiating to the neck.
*   Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
*   Musculoskeletal: Reports left elbow, arm, and neck pain.

O:
**Vitals:**
*   Blood Pressure: 150/90 (today)

**Physical Exam:**
*   Cardiovascular: Slight murmur detected on auscultation, noted as not previously heard.

    *   Obtain EKG immediately for further evaluation.
    *   Administer Aspirin.
    *   Administer Nitroglycerin.
    *   **Contingency Plan:** Depending on EKG results, will call 911 for transfer to hospital if indicated.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    *   Continue Norvasc 2.5 mg daily.
    *   Discussed obtaining a home blood pressure cuff for regular monitoring and tracking.
3.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   Continue Metformin 500 mg daily.
    *   Obtain POCT glucose today.
    *   Educate patient on the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring.
4.  **Follow-up:** Follow-up plan is contingent upon EKG results and potential hospital transfer. Nurse will assist with tests today."
aci,D2N192,"[doctor] karen is a 34 -year-old female with a history of chronic migraines and hypertension who is here today with abdominal pain so hi there karen it's nice to see you again listen i'm sorry you're not feeling well and you've got abdominal pain like to talk about that in some detail with you but hey i wan na use this new cool app that's gon na help me focus on you a bit more in this visit would that be okay with you

[doctor] okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere

[doctor] okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine
[patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual
[doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently
[patient] not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures
[doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently
[patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic
[doctor] okay
[patient] so
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare
[doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been
[patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies
[doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that
[patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great
[doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you
[patient] yes

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Cough.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms similar to an upper respiratory infection. Most likely it is a virus that is causing her symptoms, especially as she reports being around some else with similar symptoms.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that we often let the virus run its course while we treat her symptoms. I advised her to be cautious with over-the-counter cough medicines as certain ones can affect her blood pressure and diabetes.
- Medical Treatment: She increase her fluid intake. I recommended she try Coricidin HBP as a safer alternative to her cough medicine. The patient should rest frequently. I will order a COVID-19 test.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue with dietary restrictions.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue her on her metformin 500 mg twice a day. Repeat hemoglobin A1c will be due at her next visit.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Her blood pressure is elevated today, and it sounds like it has been trending higher at home as well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue limiting her intake of salty foods. >I recommend that she take her hydrochlorothiazide in the morning because it can result in more frequent urination.
- Medical Treatment: We will increase her dose of hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg once a day. She will continue checking her blood pressure a few times a week at different times of the day.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Hacking cough for about three days.

**History of Present Illness:** Hannah is a patient presenting with a hacking cough that started three days ago. The cough was initially gradual but has become productive with green phlegm. She reports associated symptoms of a sore throat and nasal congestion. She denies fever, shortness of breath, body aches, nausea, or vomiting. She reports being around her sister, who was sick with similar symptoms, just prior to the onset of her own symptoms. She has been drinking lots of water and taking over-the-counter cough medication, which she feels is not helping. She was on vacation last week and felt well, with symptoms starting after her return.

Patient is currently on a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide and reports taking it daily. Diet review indicates difficulty with sugar intake but attempts to limit salty foods.

P:
1.  **Upper Respiratory Infection (URI), likely viral:**
    *   **Supportive Care:** Encourage increased fluid intake and rest.
    *   **Symptom Management:** Continue supportive care. Recommend trying Coricidin HBP for cough/cold symptoms, advising caution due to potential effects on blood pressure and diabetes. Discontinue current OTC cough medicine as it is not effective.
    *   **Testing:** COVID-19 test ordered today. Results will be provided.
    *   **Education:** Discuss the likely viral nature of the infection and the importance of letting the virus run its course with supportive care. Explain rationale for not prescribing antibiotics at this time.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Metformin 500mg (daily or twice daily as previously prescribed).
    *   **Monitoring:** Repeat Hemoglobin A1c at the next scheduled visit (~every 3 months). Encourage continued home blood sugar monitoring.
    *   **Education:** Discuss the role of diet, particularly limiting sugar intake, in managing diabetes. Explain the purpose of the Hgb A1c test.
3.  **Hypertension:**
    *   **Medication:** Increase Hydrochlorothiazide dose to 25mg once daily.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue home blood pressure monitoring a few times per week at different times of the day.
    *   **Education:** Advise taking Hydrochlorothiazide in the morning due to potential diuretic effect. Encourage continued efforts to limit salty foods in the diet.

**Follow-up:** Follow-up plan for URI depends on COVID test results. Hgb A1c to be checked at next scheduled visit. Continue monitoring BP at home. Return precautions not explicitly discussed in transcript."

[doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that
[patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three
[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Rogers is a pleasant 50-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain.

For the past few weeks, the patient has been experiencing constant pain isolated to the left shoulder. She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle. She has also been renovating her basement recently.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.
Neurological: Denies left shoulder numbness or tingling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left shoulder are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the left shoulder was performed and reviewed in office today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe this is most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed the nature of this condition in detail, and I have ordered an MRI for further evaluation. I'm going to put in a referral for 6 to 8 weeks of physical therapy, during which time she should continue with Tylenol as-needed. If her symptoms do not improve, we can consider administering a steroid injection.

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Left shoulder pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Betty Rogers is a pleasant female presenting for evaluation of left shoulder pain that has been present for a few weeks. The pain is constant and isolated to the left shoulder. She denies any specific inciting event or trauma but notes she is very active and has been renovating her basement. The pain is aggravated by reaching, lifting, and attempting to raise her arm overhead. She is unable to lay on her left side due to pain, which disrupts her sleep. She reports the pain is always present but significantly worsens with pressure, such as when sleeping on the affected side. She has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6-8 hours PRN, which helps ""take the edge off."" Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10, which improves to 2-3/10 with Tylenol. She denies any associated numbness or tingling in the arm or hand.

**Past Medical History:** Denies previous trauma or significant pain in the left shoulder.

**Social History:** Reports an active lifestyle and has recently been renovating her basement.

**Medications:** Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg, 2 tablets, PO, every 6-8 hours PRN.

**Allergies:** Not mentioned in transcript.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports left shoulder pain.
*   **Neurological:** Denies numbness or tingling in the left arm or hand.
*   *Other systems not discussed in transcript.*

O:
**Vitals:** Reviewed, reported as ""good"" (specific values not provided in transcript).

**Physical Exam:** (Focused Left Shoulder)
*   Limited active and passive range of motion of the left shoulder.
*   Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus.
*   No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints.
*   Good hand grip bilaterally.
*   Neurovascular exam of the left arm: Capillary refill brisk (<3 seconds), motor and sensation intact to light touch.

**Imaging:**
*   Left shoulder X-ray reviewed: No fracture or bony abnormality identified.

A:
**Left shoulder pain:** Acute on chronic left shoulder pain, most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. This assessment is based on the patient's subjective report of constant pain exacerbated by movement and pressure, the physical exam findings of limited range of motion and tenderness over the greater tuberosity, and the exclusion of fracture or significant bony abnormality on X-ray. The patient's active lifestyle and recent renovation activities are potential contributing factors.

P:
**Left shoulder pain:**
*   **Imaging:** Order MRI of the left shoulder for further evaluation to rule out other pathology.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Refer for physical therapy for approximately 6-8 weeks.
*   **Medication:** Continue Tylenol PRN for pain relief.
*   **Further Management:** Discussed considering a steroid injection if symptoms do not improve after physical therapy.
*   **Patient Education:** Explained the likely diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy and the rationale for the treatment plan (conservative approach starting with PT).
*   **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to review MRI results and assess response to initial therapy."

Right knee pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Allen is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of his pain began yesterday after he went up for a rebound while playing basketball and felt a pop in his knee. He states that he experienced swelling and difficulty with ambulation following this incident. He locates his pain today to the medial aspect of his knee. His pain is described as aching and is rated at 4 out of 10. In terms of his swelling, he states that this has improved some. He is also able to weight-bear, but he finds that he is favoring his left leg while doing so. His tried treatments include Tylenol with some relief as well as rest.

The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. He reports that he does not check is blood pressure at home very often, but he typically runs 140 to 150 range over 80. He is taking 5 mg of Norvasc daily. In terms of his diet, he states that he enjoys eating whatever he likes. His most recent A1C was 7.2. He is taking metformin 500 mg daily, however there are days where he skips this because of gastrointestinal upset. He denies checking his blood sugar at home consistently and that when he does check he has been around 150.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of hypertension and diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports playing basketball, however this most recent event was the first time he played in 2 years.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports he is taking Norvasc 5 mg daily, metformin 500 mg daily, and Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.

VITALS

Blood pressure is 140/80 today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Pain with palpation over the medial aspect. Mild pain with flexion and extension. Edema, swelling, and ecchymosis noted. Mild redness. Negative varus and valgus stress test with firm endpoint.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee MCL strain.
Diabetes.
Hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to further evaluate for a possible MCL tear. In the meantime, he will continue with Tylenol for pain relief. I have also prescribed him meloxicam 15 mg for pain and swelling. He will be placed into a knee immobilizer and has been advised to remain non weight-bearing for the next couple of weeks.

In terms of his diabetes, he was advised to start logging his blood sugars daily and to avoid eating large amounts of strawberries. He will also be provided with a referral for a consult with a nutritionist.

For his hypertension, we are going to increase his Norvasc to 5 mg daily as his blood pressures have been elevated. We discussed our goal is for him to get closer to the 120/80 range.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review his MRI results.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right knee pain, follow-up for hypertension and diabetes.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Matthew Allen presents today for evaluation of right knee pain. The pain began yesterday while playing basketball when he went up for a rebound and felt a ""pop"" in his knee upon landing. Immediately following the injury, he experienced swelling and significant difficulty walking. He describes the pain as ""real achy"" and locates it to the ""inside"" (medial aspect) of his right knee. Swelling has decreased ""some"" since yesterday. He is now able to bear weight but is favoring the leg. Pain is currently rated as 4/10. He attempted Tylenol yesterday with ""a little"" relief. Rest has helped more than anything.

He also presents for follow-up of his chronic conditions.
**Hypertension:** Takes Norvasc 5 mg daily and reports compliance. He does not check blood pressure at home often. When he does, readings are typically in the 140-150s systolic over 80 diastolic. He reports eating ""anything I want.""
**Diabetes Mellitus:** Most recent A1C was 7.2. Takes Metformin 500 mg daily but skips doses sometimes due to stomach upset. He does not check blood sugar at home consistently. When he does check, readings are around 150. He reports eating ""anything I want.""

**Medical History:**
Hypertension
Diabetes Mellitus

**Surgical History:** Not discussed.

**Family History:** Not discussed.

**Social History:** Reports playing basketball yesterday for the first time in two years. Reports eating ""anything I want."" Smoking/Alcohol not discussed.

**Medications:**
Norvasc 5 mg daily
Metformin 500 mg daily
Tylenol PRN (for knee pain)

**Allergies:** Not discussed.

**Review of Systems:**
General: Denies fever, chills, weight changes.
HEENT: Denies headache, vision changes, sore throat.
Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, wheezing.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations, edema (other than knee).
Gastrointestinal: Reports stomach upset with Metformin. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (other than medication side effect).
Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling. Denies other joint pain or swelling.
Endocrine: Reports history of diabetes. Denies polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia (other than related to known diabetes).

O:
**Vitals:**
BP: 140/80 (today in clinic)

**Physical Exam:**
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally (stated ""lungs sound good"").
Cardiovascular: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur noted.
Right Knee:
Inspection: Edema, ecchymosis, mild redness noted.
Palpation: Pain to palpation over the medial aspect of the knee.
Range of Motion: Mild pain with flexion and extension.
Ligamentous Testing: Negative varus and valgus stress tests with firm endpoint.

**Results:**
Right Knee X-ray (4 views): Normal. No evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

A:
1.  **Right Knee Pain, likely MCL Strain:** Acute onset pain following basketball injury with reported pop, swelling, and difficulty ambulating. Exam reveals medial joint line tenderness, edema, ecchymosis, and mild redness. Ligamentous testing (varus/valgus) is negative with a firm endpoint, making a complete tear less likely but not ruling it out. X-ray is negative for fracture or bony abnormality. This presentation is consistent with a medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain. MRI is needed to definitively rule out a higher-grade tear or other soft tissue injury.
2.  **Hypertension, Suboptimally Controlled:** Patient reports compliance with Norvasc 5 mg daily, but home blood pressure readings are elevated (140-150s/80s), and clinic BP today is 140/80, above goal of 120/80. Diet is poor.
3.  **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, Suboptimally Controlled:** A1C 7.2 indicates poor glycemic control. Patient reports non-adherence to Metformin 500 mg daily due to GI upset and infrequent home blood sugar monitoring (readings around 150 when checked). Diet is poor.

P:
1.  **Right Knee Pain/MCL Strain:**
    *   Order MRI of the right knee to evaluate for MCL tear and other soft tissue injuries.
    *   Prescribe Meloxicam 15 mg daily for pain and swelling.
    *   Continue Tylenol PRN for pain.
    *   Apply knee immobilizer.
    *   Advise non-weight bearing on the right leg for the next couple of weeks.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    *   Discussed increasing Norvasc dose given elevated blood pressures (specific new dose not clearly articulated in transcript).
    *   Reinforce goal blood pressure of 120/80.
    *   Counsel on dietary modification for blood pressure control.
3.  **Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   Advise daily home blood sugar monitoring and keeping a log book to track readings.
    *   Provide referral for Nutrition Consult to improve diet.
    *   Discussed Metformin non-adherence due to GI upset and possibility of alternative medication if needed (plan focused on monitoring and nutrition consult for now).
    *   Advised patient to avoid high-sugar foods like strawberries due to diabetes.

**Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 2 weeks to review MRI results and discuss management of chronic conditions."

aci,D2N197,"[doctor] so donna is a 37 -year-old female she is here with complaint of headache she has a history of hypertension and diabetes so donna tell me what's going on
[patient] yeah lately i've just been having quite a bit of a headache and i mean every now and then i'll get it but lately it's just been getting worse and i've noticed that my blood pressure has been running high i've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so i was a little worried
[doctor] do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings
[patient] yeah so one of them was like one sixty over eighty seven and then the last one was like one seventy five over ninety two
[doctor] okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed
[patient] i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too
[doctor] yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar
[patient] yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred
[doctor] okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that
[patient] not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal
[doctor] okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them
[patient] well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again
[doctor] okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever
[patient] i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to
[patient] it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be
[doctor] okay
[patient] if i did n't take the tylenol
[doctor] yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before
[patient] not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one
[doctor] okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose
[patient] yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache
[doctor] okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness
[patient] right here
[doctor] yeah
[patient] just a little not really too much
[doctor] okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there
[patient] a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here
[doctor] okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness
[patient] it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say
[doctor] okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests things like that and and then for your diabetes i'm gon na have some diabetic education for you that i want you to be able to review it sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high and after you get the blood tests after that's all done i want you to come in to see me or doctor ruth and we'll just make sure that everything is okay that we get your blood pressure under control any questions for me

**Chief Complaint:** Headache.

**History of Present Illness:**
37-year-old female presents with a complaint of headaches that have been occurring lately and are worsening. She reports that she occasionally gets headaches, but these are different and more frequent. She describes the headaches as pounding, rating them a 7/10 initially. Taking Tylenol reduces the severity to 4-5/10, but the headache persists throughout the day. She denies having typical migraines like those she has experienced rarely in the past (once every 1-2 years). She associates the headaches with elevated home blood pressure readings over the past three weeks, reporting values such as 160/87 and 175/92. She admits to sometimes forgetting to take her lisinopril, particularly on weekends when she is busy. She has been monitoring her blood sugar due to her history of diabetes, reporting readings typically around 120, sometimes dropping to 100. She denies increased urination, cough, runny nose, or congestion.

**Medical History:**
*   Hypertension
*   Diabetes
*   History of rare migraines (once every 1-2 years)

**Surgical History:**
*   Not discussed in transcript.

**Family History:**
*   Not discussed in transcript.

**Social History:**
*   Walks for exercise.
*   Reports forgetting medication doses on weekends.

**Allergies:**
*   Seasonal allergies (reaction not specified).

**Medications:**
*   Lisinopril 20 mg PO QD (reports forgetting doses)
*   Tylenol PRN headache (dose/frequency not specified)

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Denies fever, chills (not discussed).
*   **HEENT:** Denies congestion, runny nose. Reports headaches.
*   **Respiratory:** Denies cough.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Reports elevated home blood pressure readings.
*   **Genitourinary:** Denies increased urination (polyuria).
*   **Neurological:** Reports headaches. Denies typical migraine pattern.
*   **Endocrine:** Reports monitoring blood sugar, readings 100-120s.

O:
**Vital Signs:**
*   Previous clinic BP: 124/82 (mentioned by physician)
*   Home BP readings reported by patient: 160/87, 175/92 (validated as high by physician)

**Physical Exam:** (Limited exam performed as described by physician)
*   **Head:** No frontal sinus tenderness to palpation/tapping. No maxillary sinus tenderness to palpation/tapping.
*   **Neck:** No lymphadenopathy to palpation/pushing.

**Laboratory/Imaging:**
*   None performed at visit.

A:
1.  **Hypertension, poorly controlled:** Patient presents with significantly elevated home blood pressure readings (up to 175/92), a notable increase from her last clinic visit (124/82). This is likely exacerbated by reported medication non-adherence, particularly on weekends. Poorly controlled hypertension is the suspected etiology for her current headaches. Sinusitis and lymphadenopathy were considered and ruled out on limited exam.
2.  **Headache, likely secondary to hypertension:** Patient reports new onset, worsening headaches described as pounding, partially relieved by Tylenol. Given the concurrent significant elevation in blood pressure, the headaches are assessed as likely secondary to hypertension. Other causes such as typical migraines or sinus issues were considered and deemed less likely based on patient report and limited exam.
3.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Patient reports monitoring blood sugar with readings typically in the 120s, sometimes 100, suggesting reasonable control based on home monitoring, though the physician notes readings have been ""a little bit high"". Further evaluation with Hgb A1c is warranted.

P:
1.  **Hypertension, poorly controlled:**
    *   **Medication:** Increase Lisinopril from 20 mg PO QD to 40 mg PO QD.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue home blood pressure monitoring.
    *   **Labs:** Order routine blood work.
    *   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic for follow-up visit to review lab results and assess blood pressure control.
2.  **Headache, likely secondary to hypertension:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Tylenol PRN for headache pain.
    *   **Activity:** Encourage continuation of walking exercise program.
3.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Labs:** Order Hemoglobin A1c.
    *   **Education:** Provide diabetic education material for review.
    *   **Follow-up:** Review Hgb A1c results at the follow-up visit.

**Follow-up:** Patient instructed to return to clinic to see physician or Dr. Ruth to review lab results and further manage hypertension and diabetes. Continue walking exercise. Continue home BP monitoring. Take Lisinopril 40mg daily. Continue Tylenol PRN. Review diabetic education material."

[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you
[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days

[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway
[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct
[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep

[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment
[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost
[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them
[patient] okay that's that's good to know
[doctor] yes
[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests
[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today
[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and right after that i have to go to work
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh
[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes
[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay

**Imaging:**
*   **CT Scan:** Reviewed. Demonstrates findings concerning for glomerulonephritis (described as ""swelling"").

A:
**1. Glomerulonephritis, possible:** Patient presents with a history of recurrent strep throat and a recent CT scan showing findings concerning for glomerulonephritis (""swelling""). While the patient reports left back pain, physical exam did not reveal tenderness on palpation. The potential link between recurrent strep infections and glomerulonephritis was discussed as the primary concern based on the CT findings.
**2. Recurrent Strep Throat:** Patient reports 4 episodes in the last 5 months, previously diagnosed by his PCP and associated with sore throat and fever. Physical exam today shows no current signs of pharyngitis. This history is relevant given the potential association with glomerulonephritis.
**3. Left Back Pain:** Patient reports intermittent left-sided back pain, varying in character and location. Physical exam today did not elicit tenderness with palpation. Etiology unclear, but not the primary focus given the CT findings.

P:
**1. Glomerulonephritis, possible:**

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will contact the patient with his lab results when ready.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Cough. Patient also reports right knee pain after a fall.

**History of Present Illness:** 74-year-old male presents with a cough that started approximately one week ago. Initially non-productive, it has become productive with yellow sputum over the past two days, during which time he reports feeling worse. He reports associated nasal congestion, drainage down his throat, and sinus pressure. He denies fevers (though feels warm), chills, and shortness of breath. He reports generalized body aches at times. He has been taking over-the-counter cough and cold medication (Dayquil), which has provided slight relief.

Today, while coughing, he fell down approximately four to five stairs, injuring his right knee. He reports immediate pain in the right knee, primarily on the inside (medial aspect). He is able to walk but reports a slight limp. He can bend and straighten the knee and denies instability or feeling like it will give out. He has not taken any medication specifically for the knee pain.

**Past Medical History:** Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus.

**Social History:** Works as a teacher. Reports not checking blood pressure or blood sugars at home and not watching salt or sugar intake. Lives with wife.

**Medications:**
Lisinopril 20 mg daily (patient reports taking a white pill, dose confirmed by doctor)
Metformin 1000 mg twice daily (patient reports taking a big pill twice daily, dose/frequency confirmed by doctor)
Dayquil (OTC, for cough/cold)

**Allergies:** None mentioned.

**Review of Systems:**
Constitutional: Reports feeling warm, reports body aches. Denies fevers, denies chills.
HEENT: Reports nasal congestion, drainage down throat, sinus pressure. Denies sore throat.
Respiratory: Reports cough productive of yellow sputum. Denies shortness of breath.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations.
Musculoskeletal: Reports body aches, reports right knee pain. Denies right knee instability.

O:
**Vital Signs:**
Temperature: 98.4 °F
Blood Pressure: 125/62 mmHg
Heart Rate: 80s bpm, regular
Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air

**Physical Exam:**
Head and Face: Pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
Nose: Erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge.
Throat: Uvula midline, no erythema, edema, or exudate in the peritonsillar space.
Neck: Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated.
Lungs: Coarse rhonchi present bilaterally, clears with cough.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur appreciated.
Right Knee: Pain to palpation. Decreased flexion and extension. Associated ecchymosis to the medial aspect. No evidence of an effusion.

A:
1.  **Viral Syndrome/Mild Bronchitis:** Patient presents with a productive cough, nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and constitutional symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory infection. Objective findings of bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, nasal congestion/discharge, cervical lymphadenopathy, and bilateral coarse rhonchi that clear with cough support a diagnosis of viral syndrome likely involving mild bronchitis. Pneumonia is considered in the differential given the productive cough and rhonchi, but denied symptoms of fever, chills, and shortness of breath, along with rhonchi clearing with cough, make it less likely at this time.
2.  **Right Medial Collateral Ligament Strain:** Patient reports twisting his right knee during a fall down stairs today. Subjective report of medial knee pain and objective findings of pain to palpation over the right knee, decreased range of motion (flexion/extension), and medial ecchymosis are consistent with a ligamentous injury, specifically a medial collateral ligament strain. No effusion or reported instability decreases concern for more severe internal derangement. Fracture is considered given the fall mechanism.
3.  **Hypertension:** Patient has a history of hypertension. Blood pressure is well-controlled in the office today (125/62). Patient reports not monitoring blood pressure at home or watching salt intake, but reports taking prescribed lisinopril.
4.  **Diabetes Mellitus:** Patient has a history of diabetes. Patient reports not monitoring blood sugars at home and not watching sugar intake, but reports taking prescribed metformin. No objective data regarding glycemic control available from the transcript.

P:
1.  **Viral Syndrome/Mild Bronchitis:**
    *   Continue supportive care and over-the-counter medications as needed.
    *   Prescribe Guaifenesin 600 mg twice daily to help with phlegm expectoration.
    *   Patient education provided: Antibiotics are not indicated for a viral infection at this time.
    *   Return precautions: Patient instructed to call if symptoms worsen (e.g., increased fever, shortness of breath, worsening cough), at which point a chest x-ray will be considered to rule out pneumonia.
2.  **Right Medial Collateral Ligament Strain:**
    *   Prescribe Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and inflammation.
    *   Referral to physical therapy to help strengthen muscles around the knee.
    *   Order Right Knee X-ray to rule out fracture given the fall mechanism.
3.  **Hypertension:**
    *   Continue Lisinopril 20 mg daily.
    *   Order Lipid Panel.
    *   Patient education provided regarding the importance of home blood pressure monitoring and dietary modifications (implied by discussion).
4.  **Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   Continue Metformin 1000 mg twice daily.
    *   Order Hemoglobin A1c to assess glycemic control.
    *   Patient education provided regarding the importance of monitoring blood sugars and dietary modifications to prevent long-term complications (kidney dysfunction, eye problems).
    *   Plan for patient to begin monitoring blood sugars and report levels via the patient portal.

**Follow-up:** Patient will be contacted with results of ordered labs and imaging."

**Chief Complaint:** Headache and high blood pressure.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient is a female presenting with headaches and elevated blood pressure. Headaches are located on the top of her head, described as throbbing, occurring on and off for approximately one month. They are partially alleviated by Tylenol. Associated symptoms include occasional dizziness and blurry vision. She denies chest pain and shortness of breath. Her blood pressure has been historically high, and she is prescribed chlorthalidone but reports taking it only every other day due to stomachache. She also has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and reports taking her prescribed metformin every other day, often at the same time as her chlorthalidone. She reports a diet high in sodium, including frequent fast food (McDonald's, specifically Filet-O-Fish). She also reports eating a significant amount of Easter candy over the past weekend, which she suspects may have contributed to her elevated blood sugar.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Hypertension
*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**Past Surgical History:** Denied.

**Family History:** Not discussed.

**Social History:** Reports poor adherence to low-sodium diet, frequent fast food consumption. Reports poor adherence to medication regimen (chlorthalidone and metformin taken every other day).

*   **HEENT:** Headaches as described above. Blurry vision reported.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain.
*   **Respiratory:** Denies shortness of breath.
*   **Neurological:** Dizziness reported.

**Medications:**
*   Chlorthalidone - Dose/Route/Frequency not specified, but patient reports taking ""every other day"".
*   Metformin - Dose/Route/Frequency not specified, but patient reports taking ""every other day"".

**Allergies:**
*   Chlorthalidone - causes stomachache.

O:
**Vital Signs:**
*   Blood Pressure: 172/98
*   Heart Rate: Within normal limits (value not specified)
*   Oxygen Saturation: Fine (value not specified)

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Neck:** No jugular venous distention appreciated. No carotid bruits noted.
*   **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur noted, unchanged from prior year.
*   **Extremities:** Slight edema noted in bilateral upper extremities. 1+ pitting edema noted in bilateral lower extremities.

**Laboratory/Imaging:**
*   Fasting Blood Sugar (today): 170 mg/dL

A:
1.  **Uncontrolled Hypertension:** Based on today's elevated blood pressure (172/98), patient-reported headaches, dizziness, blurry vision, and objective findings of bilateral lower extremity pitting edema (1+), suggesting fluid retention likely exacerbated by high sodium intake. Contributing factors likely include poor medication adherence (chlorthalidone taken every other day) and high-sodium diet. Murmur noted but unchanged from prior year.
2.  **Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Based on today's elevated fasting blood sugar (170 mg/dL) and patient-reported poor medication adherence (metformin taken every other day). Recent consumption of Easter candy may be a contributing factor.

P:
1.  **Uncontrolled Hypertension:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Chlorthalidone. Strongly encouraged daily adherence; suggested setting a reminder (e.g., on phone).
    *   **Monitoring:** Recommend obtaining a home blood pressure monitor. Instructed patient to monitor blood pressure three times per week.
    *   **Diet:** Refer to nutritionist for counseling on dietary changes, specifically recommending a DASH diet to reduce sodium intake. Discussed limiting fast food (McDonald's) but allowing it occasionally.
    *   **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 1 month to re-evaluate blood pressure control.
2.  **Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Medication:** Increase Metformin dose to 1500 mg (frequency not specified, but presumably daily based on standard practice and discussion of adherence).
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue home blood sugar monitoring as usual to assess effectiveness of medication change.
    *   **Follow-up:** Re-evaluate blood sugar control at the 1-month follow-up appointment.

**Follow-up:** Patient to follow up in 4 weeks (1 month)."

[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
[patient] no

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Steven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 years ago after he fell and landed onto his back while playing basketball. His pain is rated at 7 out of 10 and is described a sharp with occasional throbbing. At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports previously playing basketball, but he is now not very active and sits at home all day. He has a history of smoking, but denies smoking currently.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his 4th cousin has scoliosis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Genitourinary: Denies bowel or bladder changes.
Musculoskeletal: Reports back pain.

VITALS

Oxygen saturation is in 95 percentile range.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No Murmur.
NEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness along the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg raise.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.

ASSESSMENT

Chronic lumbar back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Back pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Steven presents for evaluation of chronic back pain. The pain began approximately 2 years ago after he fell and landed on his back while playing basketball. He rates his pain as a 7 out of 10. He describes the pain as sharp with occasional throbbing. The pain sometimes radiates down his left leg, and he experiences intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing aggravates his pain and causes weakness. Lying on his side provides some relief. He reports one episode of bowel incontinence over the last 2 years, which he attributes to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption; he denies consistent bowel or bladder incontinence and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has previously tried an injection (type unknown) and physical therapy, which provided minimal relief. He also tried pain medication (""white pill"") which he states was effective. He reports a sedentary lifestyle, sitting at home and watching TV all day, and has gained approximately 80 pounds in the past year.

**Past Medical History:** History of back pain, previous spinal injection (type unknown), previous physical therapy, previous pain medication trial (type unknown).

**Past Surgical History:** Not specified.

**Family History:** Reports 4th cousin has scoliosis; denies direct family history of spine conditions (sister, brother, mother, father).

**Social History:** Sedentary lifestyle, previously played basketball, watches TV all day. History of smoking (denies current smoking). Reports significant weight gain (80 lbs in past year).

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Reports significant weight gain (80 lbs in past year), sedentary lifestyle.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports chronic back pain radiating down the left leg, associated toe numbness, weakness with prolonged standing.
*   **Genitourinary:** Reports one episode of bowel incontinence in the past 2 years; denies consistent incontinence.

**Medications:** Not specified by name or dose in transcript.
**Allergies:** No known allergies specified in transcript.

O:
**Vitals:** Oxygen saturation in the 95th percentile range. (Other vitals not specified in transcript).

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur appreciated.
*   **Musculoskeletal (Lumbar Spine):** No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness noted on palpation at the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Supine straight leg raise test is positive.
*   **Neurological:** Decreased sensation to light touch noted at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.

**Labs/Imaging:**
*   **Lumbar Spine MRI:** Reviewed. Results show disc desiccation, a disc bulge with paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis at L4-5.

A:
**Problem List:**
1.  Chronic Lumbar Back Pain with Radiculopathy

**Assessment:**
Mr. Steven presents with chronic, severe (7/10) lumbar back pain radiating down the left leg with associated toe numbness and weakness, exacerbated by standing and improved by lying on his side. Physical exam reveals midline and right paravertebral tenderness at L4-5, pain with lumbar range of motion, a positive straight leg raise, and decreased sensation in the right L4 dermatome. Review of his lumbar MRI confirms disc desiccation and a disc bulge with paracentral herniation causing moderate right neural foraminal stenosis at L4-5. These findings are consistent with a herniated disc at L4-5 causing radiculopathy, which explains his reported symptoms and objective findings. His significant weight gain and sedentary lifestyle are contributing factors. The single episode of incontinence is noted but not felt to be indicative of cauda equina syndrome given the lack of consistent symptoms or saddle anesthesia.

P:
**Chronic Lumbar Back Pain with Radiculopathy:**
*   **Intervention:** Recommend spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy at the L4-5 level to target inflammation and the disc bulge.
*   **Medication:** Prescribe an anxiety medication to be taken prior to the injection appointment to address patient's stated anxiety regarding needles.
*   **Patient Education:** Discussed the diagnosis of a herniated disc pinching the nerve at L4-5 as the cause of his symptoms. Explained the rationale for the injection as the initial treatment step. Discussed the procedure, noting it is quick and common, performed under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), and typically takes about an hour. Explained that injections can be repeated up to 4 times per year if successful. Discussed the plan to assess the effectiveness of the injection before considering chronic pain medication, explaining that pain medication is not ideal for long-term management. Advised that if symptoms persist despite injection therapy, surgical options may need to be considered in the future.
*   **Follow-up:** Patient instructed to schedule the spinal injection appointment at the front desk. Return for follow-up appointment after the injection to assess symptom improvement and further management planning."

Right shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sharon Wright is a pleasant 36-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right shoulder pain. The onset of her pain began 3 weeks ago, when she was painting on a ladder when she reached out to catch herself because she fell. She states that she braced herself with her right arm. The patient reports that she was able to get up and continue painting. She states that she experienced numbness and tingling in her arm and hand when she initially injured her right shoulder, however this has resolved. She states that she iced her arm and took Advil for pain. The patient denies any previous shoulder pain. She reports constant pain with lifting her arm overhead. The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10 without medication and a 4 out of 10 with medication.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Positive right shoulder pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness and tingling.

VITALS

Vitals look good today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Brisk capillary refill of less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Normal strength and sensation. Neurovascularly intact distally. Equal bilateral response to sensation and touch.
MSK: Examination of the right shoulder reveals limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness over the sternoclavicular joint. Good strong bilateral hand grips.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right shoulder taken today reveals no fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder. I referred her to formal physical therapy to strengthen her right shoulder. She will continue to take Advil as needed for pain.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks for re-evaluation.","S:

[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped
[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis
[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it
[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
[patient] okay that's a bright light
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection
[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] well
[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] yeah literally yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection
[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good
[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today

Vision changes in the right eye.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of high blood pressure.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Reports right eye vision changes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Eyes
- Examination of the right eye: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses present bilaterally. Right eye cornea is clear without NVI and cup-disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus of right eye shows retina is intact 360 degrees without holes or tears noted, and RPE changes in fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen of the macula, retinal thickening, and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation. Positive hemorrhage
Examination of the left eye: Cornea is clear. No NVI. Cup-disc ration is 0.3. RPE changes in fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina is attached appropriately.

RESULTS

OTC:
Drusen deposits under the RPE. SRF accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized.

Fluorescein angiography:
Reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neovascular age related macular degeneration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Wet macular degeneration.
- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the nature of the diagnosis and that this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Vision changes in the right eye.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents today reporting vision changes primarily affecting his right eye, ongoing for approximately three to four months and progressively worsening.

- Eyes: Reports decreased vision, difficulty with dark adaptation, and distortion of straight lines (metamorphopsia) in the right eye. No other eye symptoms discussed.
- Cardiovascular: History of hypertension. No other cardiovascular symptoms discussed.
- Respiratory: Reports smoking. No other respiratory symptoms discussed.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Not discussed.

**Physical Exam:**
- **Eyes:**
    - Anterior Segment: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses (IOLs) present bilaterally.
    - Right Eye: Cornea clear, no neovascularization of the iris (NVI). Peak hole cup-to-disc ratio 0.2.
    - Left Eye: Cornea clear, no NVI. Peak hole cup-to-disc ratio 0.3.
    - Fundus Examination:
        - Right Eye: Retina attached 360 degrees, no holes or tears noted. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes in the fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen in the macula, retinal thickening, presence of subretinal fluid (SRF), exudate accumulation, and positive for hemorrhage.
        - Left Eye: RPE changes in the fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina attached appropriately.

**Diagnostic Results:**
- **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** Shows drusen deposits under the RPE, SRF accumulation, and choroidal neovascular membrane visualization.
- **Fluorescein Angiography:** Reveals a focal area of leakage in the right eye.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Right Eye:** Based on subjective report of vision changes including decreased vision in dim light and metamorphopsia, coupled with objective findings on physical exam (drusen, retinal thickening, SRF, exudate, hemorrhage in macula) and diagnostic testing (OCT showing drusen, SRF, CNVM; Fluorescein Angiography showing leakage), consistent with neovascular AMD. This is noted to be an advanced stage commonly leading to severe vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage beneath the retina, causing a central blind spot.
2.  **Hypertension:** Patient reports history and current non-adherence with medication.
3.  **Tobacco Use:** Patient reports smoking one pack per day.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Neovascular (Wet) AMD, Right Eye:**
    - **Treatment:** Intravitreal injection of Lucentis (ranibizumab) into the right eye. First injection to be administered today.
    - **Frequency:** Monthly injections planned.
    - **Patient Education:** Discussed the diagnosis of wet AMD, its mechanism (abnormal vessels leaking fluid/blood), why it causes vision loss (central blind spot), and that it is a common cause of severe vision loss. Explained the treatment with Lucentis injections, including the procedure (injection into vitreous after numbing), expected sensation (no pain after numbing), and goals (slow/stop vision decline, best chance to maintain vision). Advised that some vision loss may still occur despite treatment. Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the treatment plan.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    - **Counseling:** Strongly advised patient on the importance of taking blood pressure medication as prescribed daily.
    - **Strategy:** Recommended placing the pill bottle on the counter to aid in remembering to take the medication, starting today.
3.  **Tobacco Use:**
    - **Counseling:** Advised patient on the importance of cutting back or quitting smoking altogether due to its impact on overall health and potentially eye health.
4.  **Follow-up:** First Lucentis injection scheduled for today. Monthly injections planned thereafter. No specific follow-up appointment beyond injections discussed. Return precautions not explicitly discussed in transcript."

**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up of stage III non-small cell lung cancer with new onset shortness of breath and painful swallowing.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient is a [Age/Sex not mentioned in transcript] with a recent diagnosis of stage III non-small cell lung cancer, presenting for follow-up of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. She reports new onset shortness of breath over the weekend. Prior to this, she was able to walk her dog for mile-long walks daily, but now experiences dyspnea walking just down the street, requiring her husband to walk the dog. She also reports a dry cough with no phlegm. She denies fever, body aches, sore throat, or sinus pain. Additionally, she reports painful swallowing (odynophagia) that hurts ""down here more in my chest"" when she swallows. She denies food getting stuck but notes pain with both liquids and solids, leading to decreased intake over the weekend. She has been able to drink Ensure and milkshakes. Regarding chemotherapy (Cisplatin and Etoposide), she reports mild nausea and fatigue after her last dose a few days ago, which improved with prescribed Zofran and rest. She feels she has good support from her husband and daughter.

**Past Medical History:** Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (recent diagnosis).

**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.

**Family History:** None mentioned.

**Social History:** Previously active, walking dog daily. Has supportive husband and daughter.

O:
**Vitals:** Normal vitals including pulse oximetry (specific values not mentioned).

**Physical Exam:**
- **Neck:** No cervical lymphadenopathy, no subclavicular adenopathy.
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
- **Respiratory:** Bilateral crackles noted on auscultation.
- **Skin:** Erythema noted on the left anterior aspect of the chest.
- **Extremities:** No lower extremity edema.

**Results:**
- **Prior Pathology:** Mention of a 4.4 cm left upper lobe nodule (from recent diagnosis workup).
- **Recent Chest X-ray:** Shows mild radiation pneumonitis.

A:
1.  **Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:** Patient is undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (Cisplatin/Etoposide) and radiation (45 Gy) for a known 4.4 cm left upper lobe nodule. This is the primary diagnosis driving current treatment.
2.  **Radiation Pneumonitis (Mild):** Based on recent chest x-ray findings and bilateral crackles on exam. This is a likely contributor to the patient's new onset dyspnea and dry cough, and is expected given her radiation treatment.
3.  **Odynophagia:** Patient reports painful swallowing. This is assessed to be related to inflammation extending from the radiation pneumonitis affecting the esophagus, rather than a mechanical obstruction (patient denies food getting stuck). This is impacting her oral intake.

P:
1.  **Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:**
    *   Continue current chemotherapy regimen (Cisplatin and Etoposide).
    *   Continue current radiation dose (45 Gy).
    *   Plan for re-testing and potential tumor resection upon completion of the current treatment regimen.
2.  **Radiation Pneumonitis:**
    *   Prescribe Prednisone 40 mg by mouth daily for 5 days to reduce inflammation and improve breathing.
    *   Educated patient on the purpose of the steroid, the short duration of treatment, and potential minor side effects (e.g., muscle aches when stopping), reassuring her that significant weight gain or jitteriness is unlikely with a short course.
3.  **Odynophagia:**
    *   Prescribe Lidocaine viscous solution, swish and swallow four times a day, to provide pain relief for swallowing.
    *   Educated patient that the painful swallowing is likely due to inflammation from radiation affecting the esophagus.
    *   Emphasized the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and nutrition during cancer therapy, and that the Lidocaine should help facilitate intake.

**Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 2 weeks.
**Medications:** Prescriptions for Prednisone and Lidocaine viscous solution to be provided."
aci,D2N206,"[doctor] hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient
[patient] and i'm your patient yeah
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control
[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you
[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there
[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine
[patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists
[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten
[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten
[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad
[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away
[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you
[patient] i'm a horrible active by the way
[doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that
[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines
[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past
[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past
[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they
[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of
[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right
[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well
[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass
[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out
[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend
[patient] just getting this pain under control
[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] no no no pain
[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in
[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender
[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible
[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer
[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing
[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to
[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want
[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me
[patient] no i'm friend
[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good
[patient] perfect thank you
[doctor] alright great","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right flank pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joshua Reyes is a pleasant 18-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right flank pain.

For the last 2 weeks, the patient has been experiencing pain that starts in his right flank and radiates down into his groin. He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports chills. Denies fever
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea or vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports right flank pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria.

VITALS

Blood pressure: Slightly elevated

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen.
MSK: Examination of the right flank: CVA tenderness.

RESULTS

CT scan of the right flank was reviewed today, 05/06/2022. It revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located on the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right flank pain.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient presents today with a two-week history of right flank pain. The pain originates in the right flank and radiates down to the groin. He describes the pain as intermittent, varying with fluid intake and activity level. Severity is typically 1-2/10, worsening to 4/10 during exacerbations. He reports one episode where the pain radiated to a testicle, which has since subsided. He denies pain with urination or blood in the urine. He denies nausea, vomiting, and fever, but reports possibly experiencing chills. He has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen, which provides partial relief. He has a personal history of kidney stones, having passed some spontaneously within a week and requiring surgery or lithotripsy for others. He also reports a significant family history of kidney stones.

**Past Medical History:** History of kidney stones requiring conservative management, surgical intervention, and lithotripsy.

**Family History:** Significant family history of kidney stones.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Reports possible chills. Denies fever.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies nausea, denies vomiting.
*   **Genitourinary:** Reports right flank pain radiating to groin and previously to testicle. Denies dysuria, denies hematuria.

**Medications:**
*   Ibuprofen (OTC) - frequency not specified in transcript
*   Tramadol 50mg - prescribed today

**Allergies:** No allergies mentioned in transcript.

O:
**Vitals:** Blood pressure elevated (specific value not stated). Other vitals not discussed.

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Abdomen:** No tenderness to palpation.
*   **Back:** Right CVA tenderness noted.

**Imaging:**
*   CT scan (date not specified in transcript, but reviewed today) shows a 0.5 cm stone in the proximal right ureter. No evidence of hydronephrosis.

A:
**Problem List:**
1.  Kidney stone, right proximal ureter.

**Assessment:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of renal colic, supported by physical exam findings of right CVA tenderness and confirmed by CT imaging demonstrating a 0.5 cm stone in the right proximal ureter without associated hydronephrosis. His history of recurrent stones and strong family history are consistent with this diagnosis. Given the stone size and absence of obstruction, conservative management is appropriate at this time.

P:
**Kidney stone, right proximal ureter:**
*   **Supportive Care:** Continue pushing fluids to facilitate stone passage. Continue use of urine strainer provided by PCP.
*   **Pain Management:** Continue ibuprofen as needed for pain. Prescribed Tramadol 50mg for breakthrough pain.
*   **Diagnostics:** Order BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to assess for infection and metabolic factors.
*   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If symptoms persist or stone has not passed, will discuss further management options including lithotripsy."

Shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of coronary disease, acute myocardial infarction in 2018, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and knee pain. He denies a history of gout.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports placement of a coronary artery stent in the right coronary artery in 2018.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he is a fan of basketball.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Lasix 40 mg once a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath.
Genitourinary: Denies changes in urination.
Musculoskeletal: Reports swelling in bilateral lower extremities and great toe pain.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 135/80 mmHg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Jugular venous distention up to approximately 9 cm. There are no carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when coughing.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the lower extremities: 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute heart failure exacerbation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.

2. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.

3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.
- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.

4. Possible gout flare.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.
- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic. If he starts to have worsening shortness of breath in the next 2 days, I recommend he call me as we may have to admit him to the hospital for intravenous diuretics.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Shortness of breath for one week.

**History of Present Illness:** 60s male presents with a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath. Symptoms are exertional, occurring with walking, stairs, and walking quickly. He reports needing to use two pillows at night to sleep (orthopnea), increased from his usual one pillow. He denies waking up short of breath at night (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) this episode, though he experienced this during a prior episode. He notes associated bilateral leg swelling. He reports nocturia at least once, sometimes twice per night, which is slightly more frequent than previously. He experienced similar symptoms approximately six months ago, which improved after his Lasix dose was adjusted. He admits to recent dietary indiscretion over the holidays, with increased salt intake. He denies changes in urinary frequency during the day.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
*   Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) (2018)
*   Coronary Artery Stent (Right Coronary Artery, 2018)
*   Reduced Ejection Fraction (EF) (~35%)
*   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 3
*   History of knee pain
*   Recent episode of foot pain (lasted 4-5 days, slowly resolved, located in front of the big toe on one foot)
*   Denies history of gout (as told by others)

**Past Surgical History:**
*   Coronary Artery Stent placement (Right Coronary Artery, 2018)

**Social History:**
*   Reports recent dietary indiscretion (increased salt intake).
*   Discussed basketball playoffs.

**Medications:**
*   Lasix 40 mg once daily (reports taking daily)
*   Motrin/Advil (avoids due to CKD, took recently for foot pain, stopped quickly)
*   Tylenol (finds ineffective for pain)

**Allergies:** Not mentioned in transcript.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Not specified.
*   **HEENT:** Not specified.
*   **Respiratory:** Shortness of breath (exertional).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Orthopnea (2 pillows), denies PND this episode.
*   **Genitourinary:** Nocturia (1-2 times/night, slightly increased), denies change in daytime urinary frequency.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Bilateral leg swelling, recent foot pain episode (unilateral, in front of big toe).

O:
**Vital Signs:**
*   Blood Pressure: 135/80 mmHg

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Neck:** Jugular venous distention (JVD) appreciated up to approximately 9 cm. No carotid bruits.
*   **Lungs:** Bibasilar crackles appreciated with occasional rhonchi that clears when coughing.
*   **Heart:** 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
*   **Lower Extremities:** 1 to 2+ pitting edema appreciated bilaterally.

**Labs/Imaging:** None discussed as already performed.

A:
1.  **Acute Heart Failure Exacerbation:** Patient presents with classic signs and symptoms of fluid overload (exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, leg swelling, JVD, bibasilar crackles, pitting edema) in the setting of known reduced ejection fraction heart failure and recent dietary indiscretion. This presentation is consistent with an acute decompensation of his heart failure, likely triggered by increased salt intake.
2.  **Coronary Artery Disease:** Underlying condition, currently stable except for the acute heart failure exacerbation. A new systolic ejection murmur was noted on exam, requiring further evaluation.
3.  **Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease:** Underlying condition. Requires ongoing management including avoidance of nephrotoxic agents (NSAIDs) and dietary modifications (potassium restriction). Recent NSAID use for foot pain is concerning given CKD.
4.  **Possible Gout Flare:** Patient reports a recent episode of unilateral foot pain near the great toe, which resolved spontaneously. Given his history of CKD (a risk factor for gout) and the location of the pain, gout is a potential diagnosis for this episode.

P:
1.  **Acute Heart Failure Exacerbation:**
    *   Increase Lasix from 40 mg daily to 80 mg daily. Instruct patient to take the increased dose in the morning. If needed, a second dose could be added in the afternoon (~4 pm), but avoid late night dosing.
    *   Strict salt restriction is crucial. Dietitian referral ordered for dietary guidance.
    *   Order Chest X-ray to rule out other etiologies for respiratory symptoms.
    *   Patient to call in 2 days with weight update and report on symptom improvement.
    *   Educated patient on return precautions: Call sooner for worsening shortness of breath. Discussed possibility of hospital admission for IV diuretics if symptoms worsen significantly.
2.  **Coronary Artery Disease:**
    *   Order Echocardiogram to evaluate the noted heart murmur and assess left ventricular ejection fraction stability.
    *   Referral to Dr. White (Cardiology) for follow-up and evaluation.
3.  **Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease:**
    *   Strongly advised patient to avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil) due to risk of worsening kidney function.
    *   Advised patient to continue using Tylenol for pain, but if ineffective, to call to discuss alternative pain management strategies compatible with CKD.
    *   Educated patient on avoiding high potassium foods (bananas, oranges, potatoes).
    *   Dietitian referral ordered for comprehensive dietary counseling.
    *   Order Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP) to assess current kidney function and electrolytes.
    *   Emphasized importance of continued follow-up with nephrologist.
4.  **Possible Gout Flare:**
    *   Order Uric Acid level to investigate potential gout.
    *   Discussed that alternative medications for gout exist that are safer in the setting of CKD if this is confirmed.

**Follow-up:** Patient to call in 2 days with weight update. Return sooner for worsening symptoms. Follow-up appointments with Cardiology and Dietitian to be scheduled. CMP and Uric Acid results to be reviewed."

Upper respiratory infection.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.

The patient reports that he has been doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so. He started to feel really tired and short of breath. The patient denies coughing up anything, but he feels like he will soon be coughing up phlegm. He denies having a fever, but he felt a little warm. He attributed this to exerting himself. He reports that his elbows hurt quite a bit. He notes his knees were pretty tired and he felt some tension around his knees. The patient attributes these symptoms to lifting heavy bags. He has not been wearing a mask as much recently. He believes that he caught his first cold and his symptoms have worsened. He has had both of his COVID vaccinations.

He denies any history of seasonal allergies.

Regarding his depression, he states it has been a crazy year and a half. He was a little concerned about that, but for the most part, he has been doing well with it. His wife got him into barre classes and this has been relaxing.

Regarding his diabetes, he has been monitoring his sugar levels while he is at work, but is not as consistent on Saturdays and Sundays. His diet has been pretty good for the most part, except for some house parties. They have not been elevated since his respiratory symptoms began.

The patient has been monitoring his blood pressure at home. He reports that he is very regular with monitoring his blood pressure during the week, though less consistently on weekends. He reports his blood pressure has been under control. He has continued to utilize lisinopril 20 mg, daily.

The patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Edema in the bilateral lower extremities. Pain to palpation of the bilateral elbows.

RESULTS

X-ray of the chest is unremarkable. No airspace disease. No signs of pneumonia.

Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.

Upper respiratory infection.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe he has contracted a viral syndrome. His chest x-ray was unremarkable and he has received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination.
• Additional Testing: We will obtain a COVID-19 test to rule this out.
• Medical Treatment: I recommend he use Robitussin for cough, as well as ibuprofen or Tylenol if he develops a fever.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been practicing barre classes and is doing well overall.
• Medical Treatment: I offered medication or psychotherapy, but the patient opted to defer at this time.

Diabetes type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: His blood glucose levels have been well controlled based on home monitoring, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated.
• Additional Testing: We will repeat a hemoglobin A1c in 4 months.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase his metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with lisinopril and his blood pressures have been well controlled based on home monitoring.
• Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel.
• Medical Treatment: He will continue on lisinopril 20 mg once daily. This was refilled today.

Follow up: I would like to see him back in approximately 4 months.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Upper respiratory infection.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Andrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male presenting with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection that began approximately one week ago. He reports feeling really tired and experiencing shortness of breath, particularly when lifting or carrying heavy objects during yard work. He notes the symptoms have worsened over the past week. He denies coughing up anything currently but feels like he will start soon. He denies having a fever but felt a little warm, which he attributed to exertion. He also reports bilateral elbow pain and knee tiredness/tension, which he attributes to the recent lifting. He notes he has not been wearing a mask as frequently recently and believes he caught his first cold which has progressed. He confirms he has received both COVID-19 vaccinations. He denies any history of seasonal allergies.

Regarding his other medical conditions, he reports his depression has been challenging over the past year and a half but feels he is doing well currently, aided by attending barre classes. For his type 2 diabetes, he monitors his sugar levels regularly during the work week but less so on weekends; his diet has been mostly good, with occasional exceptions. He states his sugar levels have not been elevated since the onset of his respiratory symptoms. For his hypertension, he monitors his blood pressure regularly during the work week but less so on weekends and reports it has been under control. He confirms he is taking his lisinopril medication daily.

ER follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Albert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.

The patient states he was not staying on top of his blood sugar readings and felt "" woozy "" over the weekend. His wife was concerned that his levels were elevated and wanted to take him to the emergency room. He was not admitted to the hospital. He reports that his mother is in the hospital and he has been eating poorly. He was not monitoring his blood sugars and what he was eating. When they got home from the visit he felt a lot better. Since then, he has been following his diet pretty closely. He continues Lantus insulin at bedtime.

Regarding his kidney transplant and has been doing pretty well. The patient has been pretty diligent about taking immunotherapy medication and following orders. The last time he saw Dr. Reyes was about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.

Regarding his depression, the patient states it has been about a year and a half, but he has been pretty good with that. He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out. He thinks he would probably want to continue that at least for a couple more months and see how it goes. His wife got him into meditation recently and he finds that relaxing so he feels he would like to continue that for a couple more months and see how it goes.

The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Albert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.

Hyperglycemia.
• Medical Reasoning: He was recently seen in the emergency department with elevated blood glucose levels. He admits to dietary indiscretion prior to this, but has since improved his diet. His recent blood glucose level was 162, and his recent hemoglobin A1c was 8.
• Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in a few months.
• Medical Treatment: Increase Lantus to 20 units at night.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue monitoring his blood glucose levels at home and report those to me, as we may need to make further adjustments to his medication.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: He reports personal stressors over the past year and a half but is doing well overall. He recently started meditating.
• Medical Treatment: He should continue his current management strategies. We will hold off on medication and therapy at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: The patient was encouraged to contact me if he needs anything.

Status post renal transplant.
• Medical Reasoning: His kidney function appears stable and he has been compliant with his immunotherapy medications.
• Medical Treatment: Continue seeing Dr. Reyes for management of his immunosuppression medication.
• Patient Education and Counseling: He knows to reach out to me if he needs anything.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Emergency room follow-up for elevated blood sugar.

**History of Present Illness:** Albert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant, presenting today for follow-up after a recent emergency room visit. The patient reports feeling ""woozy"" over the weekend due to not staying on top of his blood sugar readings. He went to the emergency room at his wife's suggestion due to concern for elevated levels, which were confirmed to be high. He was not admitted to the hospital. He attributes the elevated blood sugar to dietary indiscretion over the past week while his mother was hospitalized for a hip replacement, during which he was eating cafeteria food and fast food and not monitoring his intake. He reports feeling ""a lot better"" after the emergency room visit and states he has been following his diet ""pretty closely"" since then. Prior to this event, he reports being diligent with his diet during the week but less consistent on weekends when socializing.

Regarding his kidney transplant, he reports doing ""pretty well"" and being diligent about taking his immunotherapy medications and following doctor's orders. He last saw Dr. Reyes approximately three weeks ago, and everything seemed fine with good kidney function.

Regarding his depression, he states it has been a ""tough year-and-a-half or so"" but he has been ""pretty good with it,"" having moments but managing as long as he finds time to relax in the afternoon. He is currently managing without medication or therapy due to being on many other medications. He recently started meditation with his wife and finds it relaxing; he wishes to continue this for a couple more months to see how it goes before considering other options.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Reports feeling woozy over the weekend (addressed in HPI).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain.
*   **Respiratory:** Denies shortness of breath.
*   **Neurological:** Denies lightheadedness or dizziness.
*   **Psychiatric:** Endorses depression (addressed in HPI).

**Past Medical History:**
*   Depression
*   Type 2 Diabetes
*   Kidney Transplant

**Past Surgical History:** Not discussed.

**Family History:** Mother recently had hip replacement surgery.

**Social History:** Not discussed beyond dietary habits related to mother's hospitalization.

**Medications:**
*   Immunotherapy medications (specific type/dose not mentioned)
*   Lantus (initial dose not mentioned, increased in Plan)

**Allergies:** Not discussed.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Vital signs look great; pulse ox is great; blood pressure and heart rate are where they should be (specific values not provided).

**Physical Examination:**

*   **Musculoskeletal:** 1+ edema noted in lower extremities.

**Laboratory Results (Discussed):**
*   Glucose: 162 (non-fasting, patient reports not eating before visit)
*   Hemoglobin A1c: 8

A:
1.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Hyperglycemia:** Patient presents for follow-up after an ER visit for symptomatic hyperglycemia (""woozy"") attributed to recent dietary indiscretion. Current non-fasting glucose is 162, and recent Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8, indicating suboptimal glycemic control over the past few months. Patient reports improved dietary adherence since the ER visit but acknowledges prior weekend inconsistency.
2.  **Depression:** Patient reports ongoing depression for approximately 1.5 years, currently managed with relaxation techniques, including recent meditation, without medication or formal therapy due to complex medication regimen. Patient reports current strategies are helpful and wishes to continue them.
3.  **Status Post Kidney Transplant:** Patient reports stable kidney function and compliance with immunosuppression medications. Last seen by transplant specialist (Dr. Reyes) 3 weeks ago with good function reported.

P:
1.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Hyperglycemia:**
    *   Increase Lantus insulin to 20 units nightly.
    *   Patient to continue monitoring blood glucose levels at home and report readings to assess response to dose adjustment.
    *   Order repeat Hemoglobin A1c in a couple of months to assess long-term glycemic control.
    *   Continue emphasizing importance of consistent dietary management.
2.  **Depression:**
    *   Continue current management strategies, including meditation.
    *   Hold off on initiating medication or formal therapy at this time.

[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] but i wan na go ahead and look at some of the results , okay ? i had the nurse do a chest x-ray on you before we came in , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the test x-ray . so i reviewed the results of your chest x-ray and it looks good . there's no e- evidence of any airspace disease , but that does n't mean that you still ca n't be retaining some fluid , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the labs . and your labs look okay . you know , you do n't have an elevated white blood cell count so i'm not really concerned about infection . we saw the chest x-ray , there's no pneumonia , so that's good .
[patient] mm-hmm .

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.

The patient states he has had some shortness of breath and mild leg swelling which he thinks has to do with eating some salty foods at some house parties recently. His shortness of breath is primarily with exertion such as walking up the stairs. This has been going on for about 10 days now. He woke from sleep once with shortness of breath about a week ago. He also notes discomfort lying flat in bed and musculoskeletal stiffness in the morning. He states that it takes him a little while to get up.

Regarding his type 1 diabetes, he is using his insulin pump. He has been consistently monitoring his blood sugars during the working week, but notes that he checks less on the weekends, due to being busy. He is trying to avoid sugar but admits to an affinity for chocolate bars.

Regarding his depression, he states that it has been a crazy year and a half. He has tried some natural solutions. In the summer, he did daily outdoor stretching, which was great; but now that the weather has changed, he needs to find some alternatives. He is not ready to try any medications. He denies suicidal and homicidal ideation.

Regarding his GERD, he is taking his omeprazole. He has made some lifestyle modifications like cutting back on his red bull intake and other caffeine. Reducing his alcohol intake has been tough during the holiday season, but he is getting better about this.

The patient denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, and abdominal pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills.  Endorses fatigue.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain. Endorses dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Denies coughor wheezing. Endorses shortness of breath..
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses lower extremity edema.
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable. No jugular venous distention.
• Respiratory: Rales are heard bilaterally at lung bases.
• Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
• Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting bilateral lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Chest x-ray did not show any evidence of airspace disease.

Labs were all within normal limits, including the WBC.

ASSESSMENT

Lawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.

PLAN

Acute heart failure exacerbation.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid. He has noticed increased fluid retention following dietary indiscretion. He has experienced dyspnea on exertion for the past 10 days.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Lasix 40 mg a day.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and log his daily weights. He will contact me if these continue to increase. He was instructed to call me or 911 if he experiences dyspnea at rest.

Type 1 diabetes.
• Medical Treatment: This is currently stable with use of an insulin pump.
• Additional Testing: I will order a hemoglobin A1c in 1 month.
• Medical Treatment: He will continue the insulin pump. The patient will follow up with his endocrinologist.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to have an eye exam.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient has been doing well with outdoor stretching. He continues to decline the use of medications for this issue.
• Medical Treatment: I will refer him to psychiatry as his current management strategy is unsustainable due to the change in season.
• Patient Education and Counseling: We will defer initiating medication at this time.

Acid reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: His symptoms are stable with medication.
• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 20 mg a day.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. his endo","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Shortness of breath

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Lawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath. He reports experiencing shortness of breath primarily with exertion, such as walking up a flight of stairs, for approximately 10 days. He also notes associated mild swelling in his legs during this time. He attributes these symptoms, in part, to recent dietary indiscretion involving salty foods at house parties. He feels lethargic. He reports discomfort lying flat in bed and woke up acutely short of breath once about a week ago, but this has not recurred. He also notes morning stiffness and difficulty adjusting to walking upon waking.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
*   Congestive Heart Failure
*   Depression
*   Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

**Social History:**
*   Reports difficulty reducing alcohol intake during the holiday season but is improving.
*   Reports trying to cut back on Red Bull and caffeine.
*   Admits to an affinity for chocolate bars.
*   For depression, has tried natural solutions like outdoor stretching, but weather change requires alternatives. Not ready for medications. Denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

**Medications:**
*   Insulin pump (for Type 1 DM)
*   Omeprazole (dose not specified in transcript, but 20mg daily mentioned in plan)

**Allergies:** No allergies mentioned in transcript.

**Review of Systems:** (As discussed or explicitly denied)
*   **Constitutional:** Endorses lethargy. Denies fever, chills.
*   **HEENT:** Not discussed.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Endorses dyspnea on exertion. Denies chest pain.
*   **Respiratory:** Endorses shortness of breath. Denies cough.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies belly pain.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Endorses morning stiffness and leg swelling.
*   **Psychiatric:** Endorses depression. Denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.
*   **Endocrine:** Reports monitoring blood sugars, less so on weekends. No recent spike noted.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Within normal limits per nurse/doctor. Pulse oximetry looks good. (Specific values not provided in transcript).

**Physical Examination:** (As described by clinician)
*   **Neck:** No jugular venous distension. No carotid bruits.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur appreciated.
*   **Respiratory:** Crackles appreciated bilaterally at the bases.
*   **Lower Extremities:** 1+ pitting edema appreciated.

**Results:**
*   **Chest X-ray:** Reviewed, looks good, no evidence of airspace disease.
*   **Labs:** Look okay, white blood cell count not elevated.

A:
Mr. Walker is a 62-year-old male with a history of CHF presenting with symptoms and signs concerning for fluid overload. Based on his report of increased dyspnea with exertion, leg swelling, discomfort lying flat, and a recent episode of nocturnal dyspnea, coupled with physical exam findings of bilateral basilar crackles, 1+ pitting lower extremity edema, and a systolic murmur, he appears to be experiencing an acute exacerbation of his congestive heart failure, likely precipitated by dietary indiscretion. The chest x-ray and labs, including a normal WBC count, help rule out pneumonia or other acute infection as the primary cause of his respiratory symptoms. His other chronic conditions (Type 1 DM, Depression, GERD) are also addressed.

**Problem List:**
1.  Acute Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation
2.  Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
3.  Depression
4.  Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

P:
**1. Acute Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation:**
*   **Medication:** Initiate Lasix 40 mg by mouth daily.
*   **Monitoring:** Patient instructed to weigh himself daily.
*   **Patient Education/Instructions:** Advised patient to call if weight is not decreasing or is increasing. Instructed patient to call the office or 911/go to the emergency room if he experiences increased shortness of breath at rest, as he may require intravenous diuretics.
*   **Follow-up:** Call if problems with breathing.

**2. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus:**
*   **Testing:** Order Hemoglobin A1c in approximately one month to assess glycemic control.
*   **Follow-up:** Patient instructed to follow up with his endocrinologist.
*   **Other:** Encourage patient to ensure he has a recent eye exam.

**3. Depression:**
*   **Referral:** Refer to Psychiatry for talk therapy.
*   **Medication:** No medications initiated at this time per patient preference.

**4. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease:**
*   **Medication:** Continue Omeprazole 20 mg by mouth daily."

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.

The patient reports she has been walking a lot lately, 30 minutes to an hour or so a day. While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.

Regarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.

The patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.
• Neurological: Denies numbness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine. Pain with flexion and extension. Negative straight leg raise.

RESULTS

Back x-ray reveals good bony alignment with no obvious fracture.

Labs: All within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.

Back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: She experienced a spasm-like pain in her back while walking approximately 6 days ago. She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain. Approximately six days ago, while walking for 30 minutes to an hour, she experienced sudden onset back pain described as her back ""seizing up"" or feeling like a ""spasm."" She notes she may have been walking faster than usual. She describes the pain as located in her lower back, affecting both sides equally, and reports associated stiffness. She has been treating the pain with ibuprofen and applying heat, but reports it is still ""pretty stiff."" She denies any specific trauma immediately preceding the onset but notes she has been lifting weights approximately three times a week and had performed deadlifts earlier on the day the pain started, speculating she may have used her back more than her legs. She denies any numbness, tingling, or weakness in her lower extremities or feet.

Regarding her hypertension, she reports home blood pressure readings have been ""looking great"" since using the cuff suggested at the last visit. She attributes this to watching her diet, noting her boyfriend is dieting with her. She confirms she is taking lisinopril.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Denies fever, chills.
HEENT: Endorses nasal congestion, attributed to seasonal allergies.
Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain. Reports home blood pressure monitoring is good.
Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.
Neurological: Denies numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower extremities.

MEDICATIONS:
Lisinopril (dose/frequency not specified in S, but confirmed taking)
Ibuprofen (dose/frequency not specified)

ALLERGIES: No allergies mentioned.

O:
VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure well controlled in office (specific values not stated). Other vital signs ""look great"" (specific values not stated).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur noted, stable.
Musculoskeletal (Back): Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of the lumbar spine. Pain with flexion and extension. Negative straight leg raise.

IMAGING:
Lumbar Spine X-ray: Good bony alignment, no obvious fracture.

LABORATORY DATA:
Recent Labs: All look great, no elevated white blood cell count, no signs of infection.

A:
1. Lumbar Strain: 34-year-old female presenting with acute onset low back pain approximately 6 days ago, occurring during physical activity (walking after lifting). Subjective report of spasm-like pain and stiffness is consistent with muscular etiology. Objective findings include localized tenderness to palpation and pain with movement, with negative straight leg raise. Lumbar spine x-ray and recent labs are unremarkable, helping to rule out fracture or infection as primary causes. This presentation is highly suggestive of a lumbar strain likely exacerbated by recent increase in physical activity including weightlifting.
2. Hypertension: Stable and well-controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications, supported by patient report of good home blood pressure readings and normal office vital signs.

P:
1. Lumbar Strain:
    - Medication: Prescribe Meloxicam 15 mg by mouth daily.
    - Supportive Care: Recommend application of ice and heat to the affected area.
    - Referral: Refer to physical therapy for back strengthening exercises to support continued exercise and activity.
    - Education: Discuss the likely diagnosis of lumbar strain and rationale for treatment plan including PT to facilitate return to activity.
2. Hypertension:
    - Medication: Continue Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth daily. Refill ordered today.
    - Monitoring: Encourage continued home blood pressure monitoring.
    - Education: Advise patient to report any increases in blood pressure readings.
    - Follow-up: No specific follow-up scheduled for hypertension at this time, continue as needed."

[patient] it's been a week , doctor . yeah .
[doctor] a week .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , did you take any medication yourself ?
[patient] no , i did not take any pain medications . actually , i did . i did take a tylenol for two or three days , but then that did n't help at all . so , uh , the reason why it started or when it started to happen is-
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] . i was actually in gymnastics class .
[doctor] yeah , okay .
[patient] and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .

[doctor] all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .
[patient] uh , yeah . in fact , that's hurts .
[doctor] does that- does it hurt ?

[patient] uh- .
[doctor] . a little bit .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .
[patient] and for how long ? yes .
[doctor] for a week .
[patient] a week , okay .
[doctor] and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad-
[patient] okay .
[doctor] . 'cause that might help relieve your pain .
[patient] okay .

Left shoulder pain.

HPI:

Ms. Anderson is a 44-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of the left shoulder. She states that she was in gymnastics 1 week ago. The pain has been present since that time. She has pain with any type of movement of her left shoulder. She had taken Tylenol for 2 to 3 days with no improvement in her symptoms.

She has a surgical history significant for prior left upper extremity surgery.

EXAM

Examination of the left shoulder shows pain with range of motion.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder, 3 views obtained on today's visit show no obvious signs of fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.","S:
CC: Left shoulder pain.

HPI: Ms. Anderson is a 44-year-old female presenting with left shoulder pain that started approximately one week ago. The onset occurred during a gymnastics class after she ""toppled over into some weird position"" following a ""certain move."" She reports pain with any kind of movement of her left shoulder. She attempted taking Tylenol for two to three days without any relief of her symptoms.

Past Surgical History: Patient reports prior surgery on her left arm.

Medications:
Tylenol (taken previously, dose/frequency not specified)
Ibuprofen 600mg po TID (recommended)
Aleve/Advil (recommended as alternative if ibuprofen does not help)

Allergies: None mentioned.

O:
Physical Exam: Limited exam performed. Patient reports pain with movement of the left shoulder. Specific objective findings (e.g., range of motion measurements, tenderness, swelling) not described by clinician in transcript.
Imaging: Left shoulder X-ray (date of visit) shows no obvious signs of broken bone or fracture.

A:
Left shoulder pain, likely joint strain/sprain.
- Pain initiated by specific movement during gymnastics.
- Patient reports pain with any movement.
- X-ray negative for fracture, ruling out bony injury.
- Assessment based on mechanism of injury and negative X-ray findings suggesting soft tissue or joint injury.

P:
- **Left shoulder pain:**
    - Recommend Ibuprofen 600mg by mouth three times daily for one week for pain relief.
    - If ibuprofen does not provide relief, may try Aleve or Advil.
    - May use ice or heat packs to the left shoulder for pain relief.
    - Rest left arm. Avoid lifting or carrying heavy weights with the left arm for at least three to four weeks. Use the right hand instead.
    - Patient education provided regarding likely nature of injury (joint strain) and rationale for rest and pain management.
- **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in three weeks if pain persists for further evaluation. Repeat left shoulder X-ray may be considered at that time if needed."

Left shoulder and elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Jose James is a 64-year-old male who presents for left shoulder and elbow pain.

The patient reports falling on his hand while going up stairs 5 months ago and has been experiencing constant pain since. He admits he was continuing to complete strength training exercises at least 2 times per week, however, he was unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds due to the pain.

During the past 1-2 weeks, Mr. James has discontinued strength training activities. Additionally, he has iced the inflicted areas, denies taking any pain medications, and reports his pain has slightly improved but it is still rather constant. He denies tingling and numbness.

The patient walks 30-minutes most days of the week.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Retired last year, was an office worker.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal
Left shoulder and elbow, tender subacromial space. No warmth, erythema, or deformity. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer’s test. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength. Intact median, radial, ulnar sensation. Abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty can test.

ASSESSMENT

• Impingement syndrome of left shoulder

Jose is a 64-year-old male who was seen today for impingement syndrome of his left shoulder, likely related to a fall he incurred 5 months ago.

PLAN

Today I discussed conservative options for left shoulder impingement with the patient, who opted to try physical therapy 2 session per week. Cortisone injection was discussed as an option if the physical therapy does not successfully reduce his pain. Additionally, I recommended continued ice and rest.

INSTRUCTIONS

email, or call if symptoms worsen or do not resolve.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left shoulder and elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Jose James is a 64-year-old male presenting with constant pain in his left shoulder and left elbow for approximately five months. The pain began immediately following a fall he sustained while walking up icy stairs to his house. He reports falling on his left side, feeling that his shoulder and wrist took the brunt of the impact. The pain is described as constant and ""pretty bad at times."" He reports the pain is aggravated by lifting weights and he has been unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds, which is frustrating as he previously maintained a routine of lifting two days per week. Over the past one to two weeks, he has stopped going to the gym due to the pain. He has attempted icing the area, which along with stopping exercise, has helped ""a bit,"" but the pain persists significantly enough to warrant this visit. He denies any associated numbness or tingling in the affected extremity. He continues to walk for 30 minutes almost daily with his wife.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Retired from an office job last year. Walks 30 minutes almost daily. Reports previously lifting weights 2 days per week.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.
(Other systems not discussed in transcript)

O:
VITAL SIGNS: Not documented in transcript.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Musculoskeletal: Left shoulder and elbow tender to palpation, specifically in the subacromial space. No warmth, erythema, or deformity noted. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's tests. Proximal and distal upper extremity strength is normal. Median, radial, and ulnar sensation is intact. Abduction is to 90 degrees. Empty can test is normal.
(Other physical exam findings not documented in transcript)

A:
1. Impingement syndrome of left shoulder, likely secondary to fall 5 months ago.
- Patient presents with left shoulder and elbow pain following a fall. Physical exam findings including tenderness in the subacromial space and positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's tests are consistent with shoulder impingement syndrome. The associated elbow pain is considered likely referred pain from the shoulder, as discussed with the patient, and there is no clinical evidence from the exam to suggest an additional primary injury to the wrist or elbow itself.

P:
1. Impingement syndrome of left shoulder:
- Discussed conservative management options with the patient.
- **Physical Therapy:** Referral requested for Dr. Martha Rivera for physical therapy, 2 sessions per week, including home exercises. Patient agrees to start with this approach.
- **Cortisone Injection:** Discussed as a potential next step if physical therapy does not adequately improve symptoms.
- **Supportive Care:** Advised patient to continue icing the shoulder, especially, and rest as much as possible.
- **Follow-up:** Patient instructed to call or email if symptoms worsen or do not improve with physical therapy."

[patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .
[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?
[patient_guest] yeah . yeah .
[doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
[patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .
[doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Randy Gutierrez is a 9-month-old male who is being evaluated today for a cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. He is accompanied by his mother.

Symptoms began yesterday around dinnertime with clear nasal drainage, pulling on his ears bilaterally, and rubbing his nose frequently. He does not have a barky cough or a sore throat. His rectal temperature was 100.3 degrees. The patient did consume a 7 ounce bottle this morning, but mostly denied the next offered bottle and declined cereal. He is irritable and having trouble falling asleep, described “like he is fighting it”.

The patient has been exposed to an older sister who is sick and a cousin who has a sinus infection.

Treatment has included saline nasal spray, Tylenol, baby Vick's, and a humidifier. When the patient aroused this morning, he was warm to the touch. When his sleeper was removed, he was quite sweaty despite the air conditioner being on.

The patient's dandruff is also worsening. The only tried treatment is Aveeno shampoo.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Older sister.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Tylenol PRN.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Temperature 100.3 degrees.

Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat
Nasal congestion, clear mucus, rhinorrhea. Bilateral pulling of ears, no sore throat or hoarseness.

Respiratory
Positive for cough.

ASSESSMENT

• Viral infection
• Dandruff

PLAN

Viral infection
The patient presents with a viral infection and does not need antibiotics currently. I advised continuation of fluids, rest. Additionally, I suggested trying Zarbee’s for children under 1 years old. If a croup cough develops, the patient will receive a 0.5 teaspoon.

I also provided counseling to the mother to avoid giving honey to the patient for his first year of life due to botulism spores.

Dandruff
The patient is experiencing worsening symptoms of dandruff. I recommended Head and Shoulders shampoo, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral A-D 2 times per week, combined with his usual shampoo. I counseled the mother that she should be careful not to get the shampoo in the patient eyes and to not use the extra strength shampoos. Additionally, he may also use baby oil and a soft brush on the area.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return in one week for a re-check.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Randy Gutierrez is a 9-month-old male presenting with approximately one day of cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. Symptoms began around supper time last night with onset of runny nose, which is currently clear mucus. He is also experiencing nasal stuffiness and cough, described as not barky. Mother reports he has been pulling on his ears and rubbing his nose frequently. He had a low-grade rectal fever of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

Ears: Appear normal (based on doctor's comment ""Ears look okay"").
Other physical exam components not explicitly described by the clinician in the transcript.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Acute Viral Illness: 9-month-old male presenting with acute onset of URI symptoms including rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, ear pulling, and low-grade fever, consistent with a viral process. Differential diagnosis includes early bacterial sinus infection, but symptoms and exam findings at this time do not warrant antibiotic therapy.
2. Cradle Cap: Worsening symptoms noted.

PLAN:
1. Acute Viral Illness:
    *   Supportive care: Continue fluids and rest.
    *   Symptomatic treatment: May use Zarbee's for regular cough, dosed for children under 1 year of age. Continue saline mist and humidifier.
    *   Croup management: Provided a half teaspoon (0.5 tsp) of sister's medicine (likely a steroid, based on context) to be given *only if* a barky cough develops. If started, continue for 5 days. This medication is specifically for barky cough and will not help a regular cough.
    *   Patient Education: Counselled mother on avoiding honey in children under 1 year due to risk of botulism spores; agave is a safe alternative.
2. Cradle Cap:
    *   Shampoo therapy: Recommend using an anti-dandruff shampoo such as Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral A-D (regular strength only, avoid extra strength) 2 times per week, alternating with regular shampoo.
    *   Mechanical removal: Continue using a soft brush and may add baby oil to help loosen scales.
    *   Patient Education: Counselled mother to avoid getting shampoo in patient's eyes during rinsing. Explained that results are not immediate and continued brushing is necessary. Advised that shampoo helps prevent recurrence. Advised to notify clinic if symptoms worsen.

INSTRUCTIONS: Return to clinic in one week for re-check."

New acne evaluation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female who presents for new patient evaluation of acne located on the face. She is accompanied by her mother today.

Kayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patient’s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.

The patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Lives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.

FAMILY HISTORY

No significant family medical history.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Full exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Comedonal acne.
• Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

PLAN

Comedonal acne.
We discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.

Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.
Reassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow recommended cleaning regimen.
Start Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.
Follow up in 6 months.","S:

virtscribe,D2N101,"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
[patient] yes . that's right .
[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
[patient] no , i have n't .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
[patient] okay , that's reassuring .
[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
[patient] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
[patient] most likely july .
[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
[patient] i would say since i was in high school .
[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
[patient] sometimes , yes .
[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .
[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
[patient] okay . that's fine .
[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
[patient] right .
[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .
[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .
[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .

ASSESSMENT

• Macromastia.

Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromastia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction. The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.

PLAN

An extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.

Risks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.

The patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.

Return to clinic prior to scheduled surgery date for preoperative counseling and consent.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Evaluation for breast reduction due to symptomatic macromastia.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female presenting for her first consultation regarding breast reduction surgery. She has been considering this procedure for approximately six to seven years. She reports symptoms she attributes to her breast size, including chronic upper back and neck pain since high school. She has been managing this pain with a chiropractor for a few years, reporting some pain relief but still experiencing buildup of pain, particularly when working at her desk. She occasionally experiences bra strap indentations. She also reports sometimes experiencing nipple pain or numbness and paresthesia in her hands. While she does not get rashes underneath her breasts, she notes they are always sweaty. She feels her physical activities, such as working out, jumping, and running, are limited by her breast size, requiring her to hold them for comfort and to avoid pain. She has not tried physical therapy or taken pain medication specifically for her back/neck pain, though she takes Propranolol for migraine prevention. She currently wears a G cup but primarily uses a 34E sports bra for comfort due to the expense of regular bras in her size. She desires a B or C cup post-operatively. She has no children but may plan for them in the future and is unsure about breastfeeding. She reports losing 10 pounds in the past few months and desires to lose an additional 20 pounds.

**Past Medical History:** Significant for migraine headaches.

**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.

**Family History:** Mother had breast cancer at age 40. Patient is 25 and has been recommended to start mammograms at age 30.

**Social History:** Denies tobacco and illicit drug use. Drinks wine socially on occasion. Currently studying psychology.

**Current Medications:** Propranolol (for migraine prevention) - dose, route, frequency not specified.

**Allergies:** None mentioned.

**Review of Systems:**
General: Reports recent 10lb weight loss, desires further loss. Denies fever, chills, fatigue (implied by focus on specific symptoms).
HEENT: Denies vision changes, hearing changes, sore throat, congestion (not discussed). Reports neck pain.
Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, wheezing (not discussed).
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations, edema (not discussed).
Musculoskeletal: Reports chronic upper back and neck pain since high school, managed by chiropractor. Reports activity limitation due to breast size. Reports bra strap indentations occasionally.
Neurological: Reports occasional nipple pain/numbness and paresthesia in hands/arms. Reports migraine headaches managed with medication.
Skin: Denies rashes under breasts but notes persistent sweating. Reports bra strap indentations.

O:
**Vitals:** BSA 2.65 (as used for Schnur scale calculation).
**Physical Exam:**
Breasts: Inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally. One breast is noted to be slightly lower than the other. No nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally. No breast tenderness, masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable.
**Measurements:** Minimum required resection based on BSA of 2.65 and Schnur scale is 1792 grams.

A:
**Problems:**
1.  Symptomatic Macromastia

Ms. Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female presenting with symptomatic macromastia, experiencing chronic upper back and neck pain, occasional nipple pain/numbness, hand paresthesia, and activity limitations attributed to her breast size. Subjective report indicates symptoms present since high school, managed partially by chiropractic care and supportive bras, but with persistent discomfort and functional limitation. Objective findings include asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally and measurements indicating a minimum resection of 1792 grams is required based on BSA and Schnur scale. Patient is assessed as an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Given the measurements and size, there is potential consideration for a free nipple graft.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Symptomatic Macromastia:**
    *   Discussed evaluation for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Patient is an ideal candidate.
    *   Extensive discussion held regarding breast reduction surgery, including tissue removal, lifting, nipple elevation, and the anchor incision pattern.
    *   Expected outcomes discussed: relief of back/neck pain and activity limitation, improved appearance. Patient understands relief is expected but not guaranteed.
    *   Desired breast size (B/C cup) discussed. Patient understands the attainable size is limited by blood supply and likely outcome is a small C cup, which will be determined intraoperatively.
    *   Potential need for free nipple graft discussed due to size/measurements. Patient educated on potential outcomes of free nipple graft including insensate nipple and inability to breastfeed. Decision for free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on nipple perfusion assessment.
    *   Procedure details discussed: estimated 3-hour surgery time, use of drains (one per side for approximately one week), scar management with plastic tape (scars mature over ~1 year).
    *   Post-operative course discussed: recommended overnight hospital stay for pain and nausea control.
    *   Risks and limitations discussed: approximately 30% chance of inability to breastfeed, breast changes with weight fluctuations and future pregnancies (hormonal changes, potential enlargement/deflation), slight chance of altered or absent nipple sensation (especially with massive reduction).
    *   Recovery discussed: activity restrictions for approximately six weeks (no heavy lifting), driving restriction for two to three weeks.
    *   Patient understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives discussed and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammoplasty.
    *   Photos taken today for documentation.
    *   **Next Steps:** Patient is currently insured by Blue Cross Blue Shield but will switch to a new plan in July 2021. Patient will notify the office once the new insurance information is available. The office will then submit documentation and photos to the new insurance provider for pre-authorization. If approved, the office will contact the patient to schedule the surgery date and a pre-operative counseling visit.
    *   Patient instructed to return to clinic for pre-operative counseling and consent prior to the scheduled surgery date."

[patient] yes , ma'am .
[doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .
[patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .
[doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .
[patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .
[doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?
[patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .
[doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?
[patient] that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .
[patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .
[doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .
[patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .
[doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .

[doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .
[patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?
[doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .
[patient] what's oxalate ?
[doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .
[patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .
[doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .

[patient] i'm doing good , thank you . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm great , thanks . so how have you been since the last time ? i know the last time we were talking about decreasing your prednisone dose , correct ?
[patient] yes . i'm just on one now and that seems to be enough .
[doctor] aw , that's great to hear .
[patient] yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .
[doctor] okay . how many times did you do that ?
[patient] um , it was n't often , maybe once a week .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ?
[patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .
[doctor] okay . and what happened ?
[patient] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?
[patient] well , i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one . and they said , "" no , just go ahead and take it , "" so i did .
[doctor] okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ?
[patient] no , they did n't give me one .
[doctor] okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ?
[patient] well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from .
[doctor] okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising .
[patient] okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .
[patient] okay . that sounds good , thanks .
[doctor] okay , judy , please , um , sit up here and i'll take a look . shoes and socks off please .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . let me see here . okay . so where is it hurting ? in your joints right here ?
[patient] yeah , a little . also in my feet joints as well .
[doctor] okay . and how about when you bend the knee like this ?
[patient] well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now .
[doctor] okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis .
[patient] yeah . they've been like that for a long time now .
[doctor] okay . all right , uhm , ms gomez , it looks like we're moving along with your treatment nicely . we'll stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure to stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work , and i'll see you in three months .

Psoriatic arthritis management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Judy Gomez is a 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis.

Ms. Gomez is currently taking methotrexate and prednisone 1 mg daily. She believes methotrexate has been relieving her joint pain.

The patient reports she has been doing well since her last visit. She has been able to decrease her prednisone dose to 1 mg daily; however, she took 2 mg for a couple of days due to increased pain in her bilateral feet.

The patient states when she received her first COVID-19 vaccine she held her methotrexate and felt ""horrible"" all week until the next Wednesday when she took it. She felt better by the end of the week. She did not hold methotrexate for her second COVID-19 vaccine.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal: Full range of motion. Dystrophy of all the nails of the toes.

ASSESSMENT

• Psoriatic arthritis.
• High risk medication use.

PLAN

Psoriatic arthritis.
Stable on methotrexate and prednisone 1 mg daily. The patient will discontinue prednisone and continue methotrexate.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 3 months.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Judy Gomez is a 61-year-old female presenting for ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis. She reports doing well since her last visit. She has successfully tapered her prednisone dose to 1 mg daily. She notes occasional need for an extra 1 mg dose (approximately once weekly) due to increased pain in her bilateral feet, particularly on days with more movement. She finds methotrexate helpful for her joint pain. She reports holding methotrexate for one week prior to her first COVID-19 vaccine dose due to concerns about efficacy interference, during which time she felt ""absolutely horrible"" until resuming the medication. She did not hold methotrexate for the second dose after consulting a hotline. She also reports new, unexplained bruising when bumping herself, which she doesn't feel happening.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Psoriatic arthritis.

MEDICATIONS: Prednisone 1 mg daily, Methotrexate (frequency not specified).

ALLERGIES: None mentioned.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Not discussed.

FAMILY HISTORY: Not discussed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Limited review performed. Patient reports joint pain (feet, knees - improved), bruising, and notes long-standing nail changes. No other systems discussed.

O:
VITALS: Not documented in transcript.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Musculoskeletal: Good range of motion with toe flexion. Knee bending range of motion good.
Skin/Nails: Ridges noted in nails. Bruising noted (location not specified).

LABS/IMAGING: No results discussed.

A:
1. Psoriatic arthritis: Stable on current regimen, tolerating prednisone taper well with only occasional breakthrough pain in feet with activity. Methotrexate appears effective based on patient's report of symptom exacerbation when held.
2. Bruising: Likely related to prednisone use.
3. Methotrexate management: Discussed holding medication around vaccination; patient appropriately consulted hotline and resumed for second dose. Ongoing monitoring required.

P:
1. Psoriatic arthritis:
    * Discontinue prednisone today.
    * Continue methotrexate.
2. Bruising:
    * Educated patient that bruising is likely a side effect of prednisone and may improve upon discontinuation.
3. Methotrexate management:
    * Order blood work for monitoring. Patient instructed to schedule appointment at front desk.
Follow-up: Return to clinic in 3 months."

[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
[patient] all right . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
[patient] really ?
[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
[patient] okay , i will .
[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .

Heart murmur.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.

Ms. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a “new, worrisome” heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling “overly tired” but attributes this to her polypharmacy.

The patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.

ASSESSMENT

• Cardiac murmur.
• PVCs.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Hypothyroid.
• Lightheadedness/dizziness.

PLAN

Cardiac murmur
Diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.

PVCs
Her referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.

Hypertension
She is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.

Hyperlipidemia
This is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.

Hypothyroidism
She takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.

Lightheadedness/dizziness
She is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.","S:
**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** New worrisome heart murmur.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female presenting for evaluation of a newly diagnosed, ""worrisome"" heart murmur. She is unsure how long she has had the murmur or what symptoms to expect. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills.

She reports exertional shortness of breath (SOB) if she walks too fast or too long, or attempts to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. She uses a walker and reports being able to walk to the end of her driveway or around the cul-de-sac before experiencing SOB or fatigue. She states this is not bothersome unless she ""overdoes it."" She estimates her functional status has declined by 70-80% compared to six months ago, noting no symptoms prior to that time.

For the past month, she has experienced severe, bilateral leg pain, which she states limits her mobility. She saw her doctor last week for this, had a chest x-ray, and was prescribed pain medication for her legs.

She reports occasional lightheadedness or dizziness, for which she takes a pill as needed when it is severe. She does not take this medication daily.

She reports ankle swelling that has been ongoing for approximately six months. The swelling fluctuates and is sometimes worse than others.

She reports a gradual weight loss over the past year, from a usual weight of 130 pounds to her current weight of 120 pounds.

She also reports feeling ""overly tired,"" which she attributes to her multiple medications.

She is unsure if she has had any previous cardiac testing.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
- Hyperlipidemia
- Hypertension
- Hypothyroidism
- History of multiple surgeries (specifics not discussed)

**SOCIAL HISTORY:**
- Requires a walker for ambulation.
- Denies history of smoking.

**FAMILY HISTORY:**
- Son: Myocardial Infarction
- Brother: Stroke (attributed to diabetes)
- Eldest Sister: Heart problem (specifics not discussed)
- Family history positive for heart problems.

**CURRENT MEDICATIONS:**
- Levothyroxine
- Lisinopril
- Simvastatin 20 mg
- Meclizine (taken as needed for dizziness)
- Amlodipine
(Patient confirms taking all medications as prescribed)

**ALLERGIES:**
- No known drug allergies.

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:**
- **General:** Reports fatigue, weight loss. Denies fevers, chills.
- **HEENT:** Not discussed.
- **Respiratory:** Reports exertional shortness of breath.
- **Cardiovascular:** Reports ankle swelling, exertional SOB, occasional dizziness. Denies chest pain, palpitations, syncope.
- **Musculoskeletal:** Reports severe bilateral leg pain.
- **Neurologic:** Reports occasional lightheadedness/dizziness. Denies passing out.

O:
**PHYSICAL EXAM:**
- **Constitutional:** Elderly, otherwise no acute distress.
- **Cardiovascular:** Normal S1 and S2 preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm. There is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids.
- **Neurologic:** Gait is normal for age.
- *(Other systems not discussed in transcript)*

**RESULTS:**
- **EKG (Today):** Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs, as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern.
- **Blood Pressure:** Not specified, but noted by clinician as ""looked really good today.""
- **Chest X-ray:** Patient reports having one last week, but results not discussed by clinician.

A:
**ASSESSMENT:**
1.  **Cardiac Murmur:** Diana presents with a newly noted 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. This finding, coupled with her reported symptoms of increased fatigue, exertional shortness of breath, and occasional lightheadedness/dizziness, is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. While her symptoms could potentially be due to severe aortic stenosis, the relatively preserved S2 noted on exam is more consistent with moderate disease. Outside records reportedly note diastolic dysfunction, suggesting a possible prior echocardiogram, though the patient is unsure. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.
2.  **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):** Referral mentioned tachycardia. EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs and an anterior septum infarct pattern. Patient denies palpitations.
3.  **Hypertension:** Managed with Amlodipine and Lisinopril. Blood pressure noted as well controlled today.
4.  **Hyperlipidemia:** Managed by PCP with Simvastatin 20 mg. Patient reports severe bilateral leg pain over the last month. Given her age and lack of known coronary artery disease, the possibility of statin-induced leg pain is considered, and stopping the statin is discussed as a potential option to discuss with her PCP. Statin therapy would be indicated if CAD were discovered during a TAVR evaluation.
5.  **Hypothyroidism:** Managed with Levothyroxine.
6.  **Lightheadedness/Dizziness:** Patient takes Meclizine as needed. Possible etiologies include aortic stenosis or PVCs, though she denies palpitations.

P:
**PLAN:**
1.  **Cardiac Murmur / Aortic Stenosis:**
    *   Order echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function, evaluate valvular disease, and determine the severity of aortic stenosis.
    *   Discussed potential management options for severe aortic stenosis, including Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) as a minimally invasive procedure. Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR) is not considered a good option given her age and medical history. No decision regarding intervention is required today; further discussion will occur after echocardiogram results are available.
2.  **PVCs:**
    *   Echocardiogram will assess overall cardiac structure and function, which may provide context for the PVCs.
    *   Depending on echocardiogram results and the severity of aortic stenosis, consider further evaluation such as an ischemic workup or a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs.
    *   Currently asymptomatic from PVCs, so starting with echocardiogram only.
3.  **Hypertension:**
    *   Continue Amlodipine and Lisinopril at current doses.
4.  **Hyperlipidemia:**
    *   Continue Simvastatin 20 mg.
    *   Will send echocardiogram results and recommendations to PCP. Recommend discussion with PCP regarding the possibility of stopping Simvastatin due to bilateral leg pain, considering her age and lack of known CAD.
5.  **Hypothyroidism:**
    *   Continue Levothyroxine at current dose.
6.  **Lightheadedness/Dizziness:**
    *   Continue Meclizine as needed.
    *   Echocardiogram results may help clarify potential cardiac causes (AS, PVCs). Consider heart monitor if needed based on future evaluation.
7.  **Follow-up:**
    *   Return to clinic in approximately three to four weeks after the echocardiogram is completed to discuss results and next steps."

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Charles Sullivan is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of shortness of breath. The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets “mid-shortness of breath” without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling. The patient denies any previous issues with allergies.

He enjoys hunting.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: Normal on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CONSTITUTIONAL: In no apparent distress.
HEAD: No angioedema.
RESPIRATORY: No audible stridor. I do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields.
SKIN: No rash.

RESULTS

A chest x-ray, obtained and reviewed today is normal.
Pulmonary function test, obtained and reviewed today is normal.

ASSESSMENT

Newly diagnosed allergic asthma.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination, radiographic findings, and pulmonary function test results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Shortness of breath.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Charles Sullivan is a pleasant gentleman who presents today reporting shortness of breath that began approximately two years ago. He describes his breathing as ""not what it used to be"" and notes an increased need to ""catch his breath."" He experiences ""mid shortness of breath"" suddenly and without clear reason. He also reports associated watery eyes with rheum, which he attributes to allergies. He was previously seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment that helped, and was prescribed an inhaler (patient uses when symptoms are present). He notes symptoms occur in various situations: in the house, when the cat is not around, and outside. He denies any symptoms currently. He denies associated rash, nausea, vomiting, or lip/throat swelling. He denies any history of allergies.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Denies current symptoms.
*   **HEENT:** Reports watery eyes with rheum. Denies lip or throat swelling.
*   **Respiratory:** Reports shortness of breath and increased need to catch breath. Denies cough, chest pain.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Reports diarrhea after heavy alcohol consumption. Denies nausea, vomiting.
*   **Skin:** Denies rash.

**Past Medical History:** None mentioned.
**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.
**Family History:** None mentioned.
**Social History:** Enjoys hunting. Lives in the city on a large plot of land. Has a cat. Reports diarrhea after heavy alcohol consumption. Denies smoking or illicit drug use (not discussed).

**Medications:**
*   Inhaler (patient uses when symptoms are present - likely Albuterol based on plan, but not explicitly named by patient)

**Allergies:** Denies any allergies.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Vital signs look good. Pulse is okay. Pulse oximetry is normal on room air.
**Constitutional:** Does not appear in any distress. May be slightly nervous.
**HEENT:** No angioedema noted.
**Respiratory:** No audible stridor. Faint expiratory wheezing appreciated bilaterally in all lung fields on lung exam.
**Skin:** No rash appreciated.

**Imaging:**
*   Chest X-ray: Normal (obtained and reviewed today).

**Pulmonary Function Testing:**
*   Pulmonary Function Test: Normal (obtained and reviewed today).

A:
**1. Newly diagnosed allergic asthma.**
*   **Assessment:** Based on the patient's chronic, intermittent shortness of breath, associated symptoms (watery eyes), response to bronchodilator therapy (nebulizer, inhaler), and objective finding of faint expiratory wheezing on exam, combined with normal chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests ruling out other significant pulmonary pathology, the diagnosis of allergic asthma is made. The patient's report of symptoms occurring in various environments (including inside with/without cat, and outside) supports a potential allergic component.

P:
**1. Newly diagnosed allergic asthma.**
*   **Medications:**
    *   Continue Albuterol inhaler: Instructed patient to use as soon as he starts to feel *any* symptoms, not just during severe flare-ups.
    *   Prescribe Singulair 10 mg: Take once daily to help decrease the occurrences of asthma symptoms.
*   **Further Workup:**
    *   Proceed with allergy testing: Start with skin testing to identify potential triggers.
    *   Discussed possibility of further testing (blood tests) or immunotherapy if skin testing is inconclusive.
*   **Patient Education:** Discussed rationale for Singulair (reducing frequency of symptoms) and allergy testing (identifying triggers for avoidance).
*   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 1 week to schedule skin testing."

Low back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bryan Brooks is a pleasant 39-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. He is accompanied today by his partner.

Approximately 2 hours after he finished raking leaves yesterday, the patient began to feel a tightening sensation in his low back and tingling in his right foot. Prior to this, he recalls a similar episode approximately 3 years ago in which his symptoms resolved after 1 day. Ice and Advil provided no relief, but his pain is less severe when he is in a seated position and taking a hot shower helped alleviate his pain. The patient's partner reports that his pain seems to worsen when he stands up.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.
Neurological: Reports tingling in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain on extension. Some pain with flexion. Pain with palpation around L5. Dorsiflexion is normal. Pulses are equal in all extremities.

RESULTS

X-rays obtained and reviewed in office today were normal.

ASSESSMENT

Low back sprain.

PLAN

aci,D2N108,"[doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it
[patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed
[doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden
[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach
[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics
[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet
[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you
[patient] i do n't recall the name exactly
[doctor] do n't recall alright
[patient] something i had taken it before
[doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot
[patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance
[doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt
[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had that before
[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled
[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time
[doctor] okay do you
[patient] i'm not really sure how
[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it
[patient] i think they told me it was around ten
[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt
[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct
[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening
[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me
[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Hernandez is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. Onset of ulcer was approximately 2 months ago after walking barefoot on the beach. He reports the ulcer has recently become red and is draining. At times he will also experience throbbing pain. He has seen his primary care physician and was prescribed antibiotics, however, he has not started them yet and does not recall the name of the medication.

The patient is a diabetic. He is taking medication for this, however, he does not monitor his blood sugar consistently. His last A1C was around 10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with redness and drainage.

VITALS

Vital signs are normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right foot: There is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect laterally just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some redness and drainage present as well as edema. No necrosis, odor, or bony exposure. Nontender to palpation.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

Right diabetic foot ulcer.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine the blood supply in his foot. Debridement will be performed. A prescription for clindamycin 400 mg 2 times per day for 7 days will be provided as he does seem to have an infection. He will also be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support for the next month.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress and for possible repeat debridement. He has been advised to call the office if his symptoms worsen and we will get him in sooner, however, if he starts to develop a fever or necrosis he has been instructed to go to the ER.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right foot ulcer.

**History of Present Illness:** Gregory Hernandez is a male patient presenting for evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. The ulcer began approximately two months ago after walking barefoot on the beach (Dewey Beach). He reports the ulcer has recently become red and is draining, which is a new development. He experiences occasional throbbing sensation but denies specific pain. He previously saw his primary care physician (PCP) who prescribed antibiotics, but he has not yet picked them up and does not recall the name. The patient has a history of diabetes, for which he takes medication but does not consistently monitor his blood sugar. His last A1C was reported to be around 10.

**Medical History:**
Diabetes Mellitus

**Social History:**
Reports walking barefoot on Dewey Beach prior to ulcer onset.

**Review of Systems:**
General: Denies fever (based on normal vital signs).
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with recent onset of redness and drainage.
Musculoskeletal: Reports occasional throbbing sensation in the right foot; reports feeling increased pressure but not distinct pain upon palpation of the ulcer during exam.

**Medications:**
Diabetes medication (name not specified by patient)
Antibiotic (prescribed by PCP, name not recalled, not yet taken)

**Allergies:**
None mentioned.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Normal.
**Physical Exam:**
Right Foot: Examination reveals a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, located just proximal to the fifth metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. There is surrounding redness, drainage, and edema. No necrosis, odor, or bony exposure is appreciated.

**Imaging:**
Right Foot X-ray (3 views): No evidence of osteomyelitis.

A:
**Problem List:**
1.  Right Diabetic Foot Ulcer, likely infected.
2.  Poorly Controlled Diabetes Mellitus.

**Assessment:** The patient presents with a two-month history of a non-healing right foot ulcer, which has recently developed signs of infection including redness and drainage. The ulcer is located on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot. Given the patient's history of poorly controlled diabetes (A1C 10, inconsistent monitoring), impaired healing is expected. Physical exam confirms the presence of a 1x2 cm ulcer with redness, drainage, and edema, consistent with infection. Imaging of the right foot rules out underlying osteomyelitis. The patient was prescribed antibiotics by his PCP but has not started them.

P:
**Right Diabetic Foot Ulcer, likely infected:**
*   **Diagnostics:** Order Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) to assess blood supply to the foot and potential for healing.
*   **Procedure:** Perform debridement of the ulcer today to remove non-viable tissue.
*   **Medication:** Prescribe Clindamycin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 7 days to treat the suspected infection.
*   **Supportive Care:** Provide a surgical shoe to reduce pressure on the ulcer during ambulation for the next month.
*   **Patient Education:** Discussed X-ray results showing no bone infection. Explained the importance of the surgical shoe to aid healing. Explained the rationale for antibiotic therapy.
*   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 2 weeks for reassessment of the ulcer and possible repeat debridement.

**Poorly Controlled Diabetes Mellitus:**
*   **Plan:** Advised patient to follow up with his PCP to establish a treatment plan for better glycemic control, as this is crucial for ulcer healing.

**Return Precautions:** Instructed patient to call the office if symptoms worsen. Advised patient to go to Urgent Care or the Emergency Room if he develops a fever, feels unwell, or notices signs of necrosis (e.g., black tissue)."

[doctor] okay alright well let me examine you here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my match exam and i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you
[patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so
[doctor] okay
[patient] thank you
[doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them and then once if you have any issues or you know give me a call we can get you into the office and for the high blood pressure i'll go ahead and refill the norvasc today you're doing a great job with that it sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes certainly call me we can get you in sooner okay
[patient] thank you
[doctor] sounds good sounds good good great seeing you thanks stephanie

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Left ankle pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Given the nature of her injury, I believe this is an ankle sprain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient that I will contact her with the results of her x-ray, and that if these reveal a fracture, we will put in a referral to orthopedics for further evaluation.
- Medical Treatment: X-ray ordered to rule out fracture. We will place her in an air splint and have her ambulate with crutches to avoid weightbearing until we get the x-ray results. She will start Naprosyn 500 mg twice daily for pain control. Continue with ice and elevation.

2. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well controlled with her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for her diabetic eye exam.
- Medical Treatment: We will keep her on her current dose of metformin and order a repeat hemoglobin A1c. We will also obtain a set of baseline labs.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Left ankle pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Stephanie Morales is a 36-year-old female presenting today with left ankle pain. The pain began two days ago after she slipped on ice while walking to her car. Her left ankle twisted underneath her, and she fell. She was able to get up but experienced immediate soreness and pain, followed by swelling, making it difficult to walk. The pain is primarily located on the outside of her left ankle. She denies pain above the ankle, in her calf, lower leg, or knee. She has attempted treatment with ibuprofen, ice, and elevation, which have provided slight relief. She reports swelling but denies bleeding.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Type 2 Diabetes
*   Hypertension

**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.

**Family History:** Not discussed.

**Social History:** Not discussed.

**Medications:**
*   Metformin (dose/frequency not specified)

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** No symptoms discussed.
*   **HEENT:** No symptoms discussed.
*   **Respiratory:** No symptoms discussed.
*   **Cardiovascular:** No symptoms discussed.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Positive for left ankle pain and swelling. Denies pain in the left calf, lower leg, or knee.

O:
**Vitals:**
*   Blood Pressure: 120/70 mmHg

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Neck:** No bruits.
*   **Respiratory:** Lungs clear to auscultation.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Heart exam normal. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur noted, unchanged from previous exam. Pulses normal in left lower extremity.

A:
1.  **Left Ankle Pain (Sprain vs. Fracture):** Acute left ankle pain following a slip and fall with twisting mechanism. Subjective report of pain, swelling, and difficulty walking is consistent with musculoskeletal injury. Objective findings of tenderness over the lateral malleolus and, importantly, the fifth metatarsal, along with swelling, redness, and pain with valgus stress, raise concern for both ankle sprain and potential fracture, particularly of the fifth metatarsal. Further imaging is required to rule out fracture.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes:** Appears well-controlled based on patient report of stable blood sugars with diet and regular checking, and objective HbA1c of 6.8. Patient is compliant with Metformin. Due for ophthalmology follow-up.
3.  **Hypertension:** Appears well-controlled based on current blood pressure reading (120/70 mmHg) and patient report of no issues with Norvasc. Patient requires a refill of Norvasc.

P:
1.  **Left Ankle Pain (Sprain vs. Fracture):**
    *   **Diagnostics:** Order X-ray of the left ankle to rule out fracture.
    *   **Treatment:** Apply air splint to the left ankle. Provide crutches and instruct patient to remain non-weight bearing on the left leg until X-ray results are available.
    *   **Medication:** Prescribe Naprosyn 500mg by mouth twice daily for pain control.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Continue ice and elevation as previously instructed.
    *   **Follow-up:** Will contact patient with X-ray results. If fracture is present, will refer to Orthopedics. If no fracture, will transition patient to partial weight-bearing as tolerated.

[doctor] okay","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.

The patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.

Regarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever and chills.
Skin: Reports right foot wound.
Neurological: Reports neuropathy.

VITALS

Temperature: 98.1.
Heart rate: 72.
Respiration: 16.
Blood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.
SKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.
2. Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.

Regarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right foot wound not healing.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Wayne Jenkins is a 43-year-old male presenting for evaluation of a wound on his right foot that has not been healing. The wound onset was approximately 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was initially seen by his primary care physician who referred him to this clinic. He previously saw a podiatrist a couple of years ago but has been unable to find a new one since that provider moved.

He reports no specific trauma to the foot. The wound began as a blister after wearing a new pair of Hoka shoes purchased at REI a couple of years ago. Due to his neuropathy, he did not initially feel that the shoes were too tight. The blister worsened into a wound. He was prescribed a course of antibiotics by his PCP, which he completed yesterday, but notes the wound appearance is unchanged. He denies pain at the wound site, attributing this to his neuropathy. He denies fever, chills, or drainage from the wound, but notes his sock occasionally sticks to the wound, even with a Band-Aid. He has stopped wearing the new shoes. He finds the Hoka shoes comfortable, easy to take on/off, and they provide good stability, which is important as he occasionally has issues with stability.

Regarding his diabetes, his last Hgb A1c was a little over 8.

[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt
[patient] little bit
[doctor] okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] alright can you bend your knee and straighten it

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

William Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Approximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.

In terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.

His diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 180/80 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.
RESPIRATORY:
Lungs are clear bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.

For his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.

For his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.","S:

aci,D2N112,"[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today
[patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse
[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there
[patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time
[doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version
[patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden
[doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at
[patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month
[doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes
[patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here
[doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me
[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg
[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life
[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten
[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better
[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today
[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs
[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
[doctor] that's okay
[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
[doctor] absolutely
[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here
[patient] no it's right here
[doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there
[patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please
[patient] okay that's it that's all i got
[doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan
[patient] sure sounds good
[doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an ""electrical tooth ache"" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CONSTITUTIONAL: Vitals look good.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No bony abnormalities. No redness. No bruising present. Pain with palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of the back. 4/5 strength on the left, 5/5 strength on the right. Reflexes are brisk. Motor and sensory are intact throughout the bilateral lower extremities.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed a disc herniation at the level of the L4-5 vertebrae. It is associated with some nerve root impingement.

ASSESSMENT

Acute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.

PLAN

I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a epidural steroid injection into the lumbar spine today. He will follow up with me in 4 weeks to check on his progress.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Lower back and left leg pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Matthew Hill is a 44-year-old male presenting for evaluation of chronic lower back pain with acute exacerbation and associated left leg pain. Patient reports a long history of back pain dating back approximately 30 years following a fall off a roof, at which time he was told he may have had a fracture and was unable to play football. His pain has significantly worsened over the past month. He localizes the pain to his lower back, radiating into his left hip, down the side of his left leg, into the calf, and to the left big toe. He describes the radiating pain as an ""electrical tooth ache"" that goes down the entire leg. Current pain is rated 6-8/10, stating it is less severe today as he did not take medication prior to the visit, but notes it can reach 13/10 at its worst. He later states his pain is 8/10. The pain is aggravated by standing, walking, sitting (including sitting in the waiting room for 30 minutes today), coughing, and sneezing. Lying down provides relief. He reports difficulty tying his shoes due to the pain and has been using a cane due to his left foot dragging when he walks. He reports weakness in his back and both legs. He denies numbness or tingling in his lower extremities. He has previously attempted NSAIDs and physical therapy without significant relief.

**Past Medical History:** History of back injury approximately 30 years ago (fall from roof, possible fracture).
**Past Surgical History:** Not discussed.

[doctor] i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches
[patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here
[doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe
[patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on
[doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation
[patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse
[doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising
[patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the
[doctor] in my on the side of my vision
[patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face
[doctor] no i have n't
[patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running
[doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics
[patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise
[doctor] it is
[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri
[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri
[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about
[doctor] okay
[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here
[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal
[doctor] okay go ahead sorry
[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me
[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week
[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri

ASSESSMENT

Headaches, concern for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for any other condition that could be contributing to her symptoms. We will contact her to schedule this after approved by insurance. Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today. The patient agrees to the treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations.","S:

(Other exam components not discussed in transcript)

A:
1. Headaches, concerning for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH).
    - Patient presents with a history of worsening headaches, aggravated by activity, associated with ringing in the ears and blurred vision.
    - Physical exam reveals papilledema, which is a key objective finding supporting the concern for increased intracranial pressure.
    - IIH is considered given the constellation of symptoms and objective findings, representing increased intracranial pressure without an identified underlying cause.
    - Clinician expresses concern regarding potential permanent vision changes if pressure is not managed.
    - Differential diagnoses contributing to symptoms are considered, requiring further investigation.

P:
1. Headaches / Concern for IIH:
    - Obtain urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for other conditions contributing to symptoms. Pre-authorization from insurance required; front office staff will facilitate scheduling once approved.
    - Following review of MRI results, perform a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to directly evaluate brain pressure and potentially provide therapeutic relief.
    - Refer to Neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye examination.
    - Discussed potential treatment options if IIH is confirmed, including medications to decrease pressure.
    - Emphasized the importance of exercise and weight loss as key components of management.
    - Patient educated on the rationale for testing (confirm diagnosis, evaluate pressure, rule out other causes) and the potential risk of vision loss if untreated.
    - Patient verbalized understanding and agreed to the plan.
    - Follow up with clinician will be scheduled after the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations."

Neck pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jack Torres is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago after he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. He states that he was hit in the back and experienced whiplash. Following the accident he did not present to the emergency room and he does not recall having any swelling or bruising at the neck. He localizes his pain to the posterior aspect of his neck. His pain level is rated at 7 out of 10. When taking ibuprofen he states his pain improves to 5 out of 10. He finds that neck range of motion exacerbates his pain. Initially after the accident he reports that he experienced a couple of headaches, but he states he has not had any recently. He denies any hearing problems or visual disturbances.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he played football years ago without any neck issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Denies visual disturbances.
HENT: Denies hearing loss.
Musculoskeletal: Reports neck pain.
Neurological: Denies headaches.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NECK: No swelling noted
MSK: Examination of the cervical spine: Positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck. Shoulders and back are nontender to palpation. Positive pain with flexion, rotation, and lateral bending. Severe pain with extension.

RESULTS

3 views of the cervical spine were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Neck strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture or bony abnormalities. Treatment options were discussed and conservative treatment has been recommended. He will begin taking Motrin 600 mg every 6 to 8 hours. A prescription for Flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed was also provided. He was advised to be mindful of how he moves his neck and to be conservative to avoid straining his neck. I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI for further evaluation as the patient did not go to the emergency room following his accident. He will also be referred to either physical rehab or a chiropractor pending his MRI results.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Neck pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Jack Torres presents today with neck pain that began approximately one week ago following a motor vehicle accident. He reports being hit from the rear, resulting in a rapid forward movement of his head, consistent with a whiplash mechanism. He did not seek care in the emergency room immediately after the accident. He localizes the pain to the back of his neck. He rates the pain severity as 7 out of 10, noting it is not constant but is exacerbated significantly by neck movement. He has attempted ibuprofen, which provides partial relief, reducing the pain to approximately 5 out of 10. He states the pain has remained consistent in severity since onset, worsening only with movement. He reports being mostly able to turn his neck side-to-side but experiences pain with this motion. He experienced a couple of headaches early on after the accident but denies having any recently. He denies any radiation of the pain to his upper back or shoulder. He denies any associated hearing problems or visual disturbances.

**Past Medical History:** None mentioned.

*   **Back/Shoulders:** Nontender to palpation.
*   **Other Systems:** Not documented in transcript.

**Imaging:**
*   Cervical Spine X-ray (3 views): Reviewed. No evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Neck Strain (Whiplash):** Acute neck strain resulting from a motor vehicle accident one week prior. This diagnosis is supported by the mechanism of injury (rear-end MVA with whiplash), localized posterior neck pain, severity rated 7/10 (worsening with movement), partial relief with ibuprofen, and objective findings of pain with palpation and limited, painful range of motion on physical exam. Cervical spine X-rays rule out acute fracture or significant bony abnormality.
    *   *Differential Considerations:* Concussion (mentioned as possibility to rule out with MRI given mechanism and patient not presenting to ER).

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Neck Strain:**
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Motrin (Ibuprofen) 600 mg by mouth every 6-8 hours for pain and inflammation.
        *   Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine) 10 mg by mouth every 12 hours as needed for muscle relaxation.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Advised patient to be conservative with neck movements and avoid straining the neck.
    *   **Diagnostics:** Order MRI of the cervical spine for further evaluation, particularly given the mechanism of injury and patient not presenting to the ER, to rule out nerve impingement or other soft tissue injury.
    *   **Referral:** Refer to either physical rehabilitation or a chiropractor for further management and therapy *pending MRI results*. Discussed patient's reservations about chiropractic care and offered physical therapy as an alternative option.
    *   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic as needed for worsening symptoms or concerns. Follow-up appointment will be scheduled after MRI results are available to discuss findings and referral plan."

[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that

[doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you
[patient] kills
[doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you
[patient] yeah it hurts a little bit
[doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever
[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it
[doctor] yeah yeah well
[patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore
[doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presents today for follow-up regarding recurrent kidney stones, hypertension, and diabetes.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Angela presents today reporting recent symptoms consistent with a kidney stone. She states the pain has been ""up and down"" and she went to the emergency room last week. She believes she passed the stone approximately three days ago. She reports no longer experiencing pain and denies any further blood in her urine. This is reportedly her 7th or 8th kidney stone episode. She was given Percocet for pain at the hospital.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Hypertension
*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed ~1 year ago)
*   Recurrent Kidney Stones (7-8 episodes)
*   Insomnia

**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.

**Family History:** Not discussed.

**Social History:**
*   Diet: Reports difficulty controlling fast food intake due to being ""on the go.""
*   Sleep: Reports difficulty with insomnia, sometimes due to worrying. Admits to sleeping with TV on and phone by the bed. Has tried meditation apps (helpful) and melatonin (not very helpful).

**Medications:**
*   Norvasc 2.5 mg daily (Patient reports taking regularly, home BP readings 130-140/60-70 mmHg)
*   Metformin 500 mg daily (Patient reports taking regularly)
*   Melatonin 10 mg as needed (New prescription today)
*   Percocet (Received at ER last week for kidney stone pain, dose/frequency not specified, not currently taking)

**Allergies:** Not discussed.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Reports insomnia.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies abdominal pain.
*   **Genitourinary:** Denies hematuria (currently).
*   **Respiratory:** Denies cough, shortness of breath (implied by clear lungs on exam).

O:
**Vitals:**
*   Blood Pressure: 150/90 mmHg (in clinic)

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi noted.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Heart sounds with a Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, noted as unchanged from previous exams.
*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender to palpation. No masses noted.
*   **Costovertebral Angle (CVA):** No tenderness to palpation on the right side.

**Results:**
*   Hemoglobin A1c: 6.7% (result from last visit)

A:
1.  **Recurrent Nephrolithiasis:** Patient presents with a history of recurrent kidney stones, reporting resolution of symptoms (pain, hematuria) from a recent episode that occurred last week. Based on patient report of passing the stone and the absence of CVA tenderness on exam today, the acute episode appears resolved. However, given the history of 7-8 prior stones, further investigation is warranted to identify potential underlying causes and prevent future occurrences.
2.  **Hypertension:** Patient's blood pressure is elevated in clinic today (150/90 mmHg), but she reports well-controlled readings at home (130-140/60-70 mmHg) on Norvasc 2.5 mg daily. This suggests possible white coat hypertension. She reports compliance with medication. Dietary habits, particularly high sodium intake from fast food, may be contributing.
3.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Patient reports compliance with Metformin 500 mg daily. Last A1c was 6.7%, which is slightly elevated but improved from diagnosis one year ago. Patient reports infrequent blood sugar monitoring.
4.  **Insomnia:** Patient reports ongoing difficulty with insomnia, sometimes related to worry. She has tried meditation apps with some success and melatonin with limited success. She reports difficulty adhering to proper sleep hygiene practices (sleeping with TV/phone on). Patient prefers not to take prescription sleeping pills.

P:
1.  **Recurrent Nephrolithiasis:**
    *   Labs: Order Urinalysis (UA) and Urine Culture (UC) to assess for residual issues from the recent stone passage.
    *   Referral: Place referral to Urology for evaluation of recurrent kidney stones. Patient requests Dr. Harris.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    *   Medication: Continue Norvasc 2.5 mg daily. Patient reports sufficient refills.
    *   Education: Reiterate importance of dietary modifications, specifically reducing sodium intake to <2300 mg/day, acknowledging challenges with fast food.

3.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   Medication: Continue Metformin 500 mg daily.
    *   Monitoring: Instruct patient to begin monitoring blood sugars daily before each meal to better understand glycemic control and guide dietary choices.
    *   Education: Discuss the importance of regular blood sugar monitoring.
4.  **Insomnia:**
    *   Medication: Prescribe Melatonin 10 mg by mouth as needed for sleep.
    *   Education: Counsel patient on importance of proper sleep hygiene (dark, cool room, avoiding electronics before bed), suggesting using phone features like ""sleep mode"" to minimize disturbances.
    *   Discuss patient's preference to avoid prescription sleep aids.

**Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up on hypertension, diabetes, and insomnia management. Urology and Nutrition will follow up separately."

[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems
[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department
[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now
[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work
[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or
[patient] yes yes that's the name of it
[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that
[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well
[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs

Asthma.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of asthma.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient denies the use of any type of cigarette or tobacco product, as well as marijuana. Occasionally, she will be at a bar that allows smoking inside, which does bother the patient. She enjoys being outside and hiking.

ALLERGIES

Denies seasonal allergies.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports using an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Reports coughing and wheezing.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 128/82 mm Hg.
Respiratory rate: 16
O2 saturation: 99% on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. Trachea is midline. No carotid bruit.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze, bilaterally.
Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No rubs, murmurs, or gallops.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Strong bilateral radial pulses. No clubbing. Brisk capillary refill.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test obtained today is reviewed and findings are consistent with asthma.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Moderate intermittent asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and results of her PFT are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of consistency with her daily inhaler as this will help prevent daily symptoms and the need to use the albuterol inhaler as frequently. My hope is that she has less acute exacerbations as she continues to use her inhaled steroid.
- Medical Treatment: Prescribed provided for Flovent 110 mcg 1 puff twice per day. She can continue using her Ventolin inhaler 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. I have recommended using her albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs and then monitor her breathing prior to taking an additional 1 to 2 puffs. I am also going to put together an asthma action plan for her so we know what to do based on her symptoms.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 month for reevaluation or sooner for worsening symptoms.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Asthma exacerbations.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient is a female presenting with worsening asthma symptoms, including coughing and wheezing, occurring frequently over the past six months. She reports these symptoms flare up approximately every month or every other month. Triggers include getting sick with a cold and exposure to cats (specifically noting a flare after visiting her aunt's house with a cat). Symptoms are severe enough to require frequent visits to urgent care or her primary care physician, often resulting in prescriptions for antibiotics (though not explicitly stated if for asthma) and steroids (prednisone taper packs or high-dose courses). She reports one prior visit to the emergency department for severe symptoms and one hospitalization for asthma when she was around 8 years old. Her last exacerbation was approximately one month ago. She uses her albuterol (Ventolin) inhaler almost daily for coughing and wheezing, and wakes up needing it a couple of times per week. She takes two puffs when needed, which provides relief allowing her to return to sleep. She has another inhaler but finds it ineffective. She notes her symptoms make her cautious about activities like hiking, which she enjoys. She denies seasonal allergies.

**Past Medical History:** Asthma (including one hospitalization at age 8).

**Social History:** Denies smoking cigarettes, tobacco products, vaping, or marijuana use. Reports occasional exposure to secondhand smoke in bars, which irritates her symptoms, and she tries to avoid these environments. Enjoys hiking.

**Medications:**
*   Albuterol (Ventolin) inhaler: 2 puffs PRN (used almost daily, couple times/week at night). Patient notes having a second inhaler she does not use effectively.

**Allergies:** Denies seasonal allergies. Notes cat exposure as a trigger for asthma symptoms.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Reports feeling frustrated with symptoms.
*   **Respiratory:** Reports coughing and wheezing almost daily. Wakes up at night needing inhaler a couple times per week.
*   **Cardiovascular:** No chest pain, palpitations, or edema reported (implied by lack of mention).
*   **HEENT:** No symptoms reported (implied by lack of mention).

O:
**Vitals:**
*   Blood Pressure: 128/82 mmHg
*   Respiratory Rate: 16
*   Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Neck:** Supple, trachea midline, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruit.
*   **Respiratory:** Diminished lung sounds throughout with occasional slight expiratory wheeze, bilaterally.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no ectopic beats, no rubs, murmurs, or gallops.
*   **Extremities:** Strong bilateral radial pulses, no clubbing, brisk capillary refill.

**Results:**
*   Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) performed today: Reviewed, results consistent with a diagnosis of asthma.

A:
**1. Moderate Intermittent Asthma**
*   Assessment: Patient presents with frequent asthma symptoms (coughing, wheezing, nocturnal awakenings) occurring monthly/bimonthly over the past 6 months, requiring almost daily use of rescue inhaler and frequent courses of oral steroids. Symptoms are triggered by colds and cat exposure. Physical exam reveals diminished lung sounds and expiratory wheezing. PFT results are consistent with asthma. These findings are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma.

P:
**1. Moderate Intermittent Asthma**
*   **Medications:**
    *   Start Flovent 110 mcg, 1 puff by mouth twice daily. Explained this is an inhaled steroid for long-term control to prevent daily symptoms and reduce the need for the rescue inhaler. Emphasized consistency is key, and it is not a fast-acting inhaler like albuterol.
    *   Continue Ventolin (albuterol) inhaler, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed for acute symptoms.
    *   Instructed patient on use of albuterol for acute exacerbations: 1-2 puffs, wait and assess breathing before taking an additional 1-2 puffs if needed.
*   **Patient Education:** Discussed the importance of consistent use of the inhaled steroid (Flovent) for long-term control and prevention of exacerbations. Explained the role of the rescue inhaler (Ventolin) for acute symptom relief. Discussed identifying and avoiding triggers like colds and cat exposure.
*   **Asthma Action Plan:** Will create an individualized asthma action plan based on symptoms and triggers.
*   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 1 month for reevaluation, or sooner if symptoms worsen."
aci,D2N120,"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today
[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now

[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain
[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot
[doctor] okay
[patient] let me separate these
[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area
[patient] no nothing like that
[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness
[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no
[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels
[patient] no
[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they
[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like
[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient] exactly
[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members
[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke
[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago
[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
[patient] okay that's painful
[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that
[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright sounds good
[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection
[patient] alright thank you
[doctor] alright thank you
[patient] bye","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Larry Garcia is a pleasant 41-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain.

The onset of his pain began 2 years ago, after moving furniture. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain as sharp and stabbing. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates distally into his right leg and occasionally into his great toe. Sitting will increase his pain and he notes he is unable to get comfortable. The patient also reports numbness and tingling, especially in his right leg that radiates distally to his foot. He adds that he tries to be as active as he can, however it has been difficult with his back pain. The patient adds that he has gained weight over the past year. He denies any loss of sensation in his genital or rectal area, weakness, or loss of bladder or bowel control.

In the past, he has attended physical therapy. The patient has also been prescribed pain medications, however they only provided temporary relief. He would like to avoid any surgical procedure at this time.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He quit smoking 20 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient denies any family history of spine conditions.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports weight gain.
Musculoskeletal: Reports lower back pain.
Neurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in the right leg and foot. Denies loss of bowl or bladder control, or loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area.

VITALS

Vitals are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness at L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion. Supine straight leg test is positive.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. This revealed a disc herniation with nerve impingement.

ASSESSMENT

L4-5 herniated disc with radiculopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his symptoms are consistent with an L4-5 herniated disc with radiculopathy. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a cortisone injection into the lumbar spine today.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Chronic lower back pain radiating to the right leg.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Larry Garcia is a 41-year-old male presenting for evaluation of chronic lower back pain of two years duration. The pain began after moving furniture, with no specific injury, fall, or accident recalled. He describes the pain as sharp and stabbing, located in his lower back, radiating down his right leg, occasionally extending to his right great toe. The pain is aggravated by sitting, making it difficult to get comfortable. He reports associated numbness and tingling, particularly in his right leg radiating down to his foot. He denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area, weakness, or loss of bladder or bowel control. The pain has significantly impacted his activity level, leading to difficulty being active and weight gain over the past year, preventing him from playing golf. He has previously tried physical therapy and strong pain medications, which provided only temporary relief. Surgery has been mentioned in the past, but he wishes to avoid it at this time.

**Past Medical History:** None mentioned other than chronic back pain.
**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.
**Family History:** Denies family history of spine conditions.
**Social History:** Quit smoking 20 years ago. Reports weight gain and decreased activity level due to pain.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Reports weight gain.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports chronic lower back pain radiating to the right leg.
*   **Neurological:** Reports numbness and tingling in the right leg and foot. Denies weakness, loss of bladder or bowel control, or loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area.
*   **Other systems:** Not reviewed/discussed.

**Medications:** None mentioned.
**Allergies:** None mentioned.

**Vitals:** Reviewed, reported as overall good/within normal limits. Specific values not provided.

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Musculoskeletal (Back):** No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness noted at the L4-L5 disk space. Right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness present. Lumbar flexion causes pain. Supine straight leg test is positive.
*   **Neurological:** Decreased sensation to light touch noted at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.

**Results:**
*   **MRI Lumbar Spine:** Reviewed today, shows disk herniation with nerve impingement.

A:
**Problem List:**
1.  Chronic Lumbar Back Pain with Radiculopathy

**Assessment:** Based on the patient's chronic symptoms of sharp, radiating lower back pain with associated numbness and tingling in the right leg, physical exam findings of midline and paravertebral tenderness, pain with flexion, positive straight leg test, and decreased sensation in the right L4 dermatome, combined with the MRI findings of L4-L5 disk herniation with nerve impingement, the patient's presentation is consistent with L4-L5 herniated disk with radiculopathy. This involves a bulging disk pinching spinal nerves, explaining the radiating symptoms.

P:
**Plan for L4-L5 Herniated Disk with Radiculopathy:**
*   Discussed assessment findings with the patient, explaining that symptoms are consistent with an L4-L5 herniated disk with radiculopathy based on history, exam, and MRI.
*   Recommended a spinal injection with a corticosteroid under fluoroscopy guidance to target the area of pain and reduce inflammation.
*   Explained the procedure is relatively quick and common, typically taking less than an hour in the office.
*   Discussed frequency, noting that intervals vary based on response, but typically no more than four injections per year are performed.
*   Patient expressed understanding and agreed to proceed.
*   Will proceed with the first lumbar corticosteroid injection today or schedule as appropriate.
*   Follow-up: Monitor response to injection. Return precautions not explicitly discussed."
aci,D2N121,"[patient] hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since

[patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days
[doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing
[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it
[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] no just the swelling and the pain
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day
[doctor] okay and
[patient] putting a cold pack on it
[doctor] okay and has that helped at all
[patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though

[patient] yeah that's sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt
[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore
[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan

He reports feeling a stretching sensation at the time of injury, but denies hearing or feeling a pop. The knee subsequently swelled. He was able to get out of the water but found it very sore to climb, squat, or bend the knee. He denies any prior injury to this knee. He reports taking over-the-counter Aleve twice a day and applying a cold pack, which has helped a fair amount, but the knee remains pretty sore. He denies any numbness or tingling in his right foot since the injury.

**Past Medical History:** Hypertension.

**Past Surgical History:** Tonsillectomy (year not specified).

**Social History:** Frequent water skier on Lake Martin.

**Medications:**
Lisinopril 20 mg daily
Aleve (OTC) twice a day (dose not specified)

Cough.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of rheumatoid arthritis. He denies any previous history of lung infections or pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he stopped smoking tobacco 7 years ago and has felt better since doing so. He notes that he enjoys biking.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his mother has a history of breast cancer, but is doing well. He denies any family history of lung cancer.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking methotrexate 7.5 mg every week.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 124/76 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 70 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No clicks, rubs, or murmurs. Pulses are intact in all extremities.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No lower extremity edema. Mild swelling to the 3rd digit knuckles on the bilateral hands, consistent with RA.

Integumentary
- Examination: Skin is pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill is brisk.

RESULTS

CT scan of chest, obtained at an outside facility, is reviewed today and demonstrates a solitary 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.

2. Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.
- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Incidentally found lung nodule.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents today for evaluation of a lung nodule. Approximately three months ago, he developed an intermittent cough, which he first noticed after loading hay. The cough worsened around that time, and he subsequently developed a cold, prompting a visit to his primary care physician (PCP). The PCP diagnosed bronchitis and ordered a chest x-ray (CXR) to rule out pneumonia. The CXR incidentally revealed a lung nodule, which was confirmed by a subsequent CT scan. He was then referred to this specialist for further management. The patient reports his cough has since resolved. He denies current pain or shortness of breath. He expresses nervousness regarding the finding.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Patient reports RA is ""fairly"" controlled with medication. Denies recent flares, notes occasional issues with hands.
*   Pulmonary: Denies previous history of lung infections or pneumonia.

**Social History:**
*   Smoking: Former smoker, quit approximately 7 years ago. Reports feeling better since quitting.
*   Hobbies: Enjoys biking.

**Family History:**
*   Mother: History of breast cancer, currently doing well.
*   Denies family history of lung cancer or other malignancies.

**Medications:**
*   Methotrexate 7.5 mg by mouth every week.

**Review of Systems:**
*   General: Denies fever, denies pain.
*   Respiratory: Reports resolved cough, denies shortness of breath. Denies history of lung infections or pneumonia.
*   Musculoskeletal: Reports history of RA, currently controlled with medication, notes occasional hand issues, denies recent flares.

O:
**Vital Signs:**
*   Blood Pressure: 124/76 mmHg
*   Heart Rate: 70 bpm
*   Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
*   Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air
*   Temperature: Afebrile

**Physical Exam:**
*   Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation.
*   Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no clicks, rubs, or murmurs appreciated. No extra beats. Pulses intact in all extremities.
*   Musculoskeletal: No edema to lower extremities. Mild swelling noted to the knuckles of the 3rd digit bilaterally, consistent with RA.
*   Integumentary: Skin pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill brisk.

**Imaging Results:**
*   Chest CT (reviewed): Solitary 2 cm nodule noted in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe (RUL). Nodule appears smooth in appearance. No evidence of emphysematous disease.

A:
1.  **Right Upper Lobe Lung Nodule:** Incidental finding on recent CT scan performed following workup for cough. The nodule is solitary, 2 cm, located in the RUL, and appears smooth. Given the patient's significant past smoking history, surgical evaluation and removal are recommended despite the potentially benign appearance. Differential diagnoses include malignancy vs. inflammatory process.
2.  **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Chronic condition, reported as fairly controlled with current methotrexate therapy. Patient denies recent flares, and exam findings of mild hand swelling are consistent with known RA. Clinically stable based on patient report and exam.

P:
1.  **Right Upper Lobe Lung Nodule:**
    *   **Further Workup:** Order Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) to establish baseline lung function. Schedule a PET CT scan to assess for metabolic activity of the nodule (to help differentiate between malignant and inflammatory processes).
    *   **Treatment:** Recommend surgical excision of the nodule via Video Assisted Thoracoscopy (VATS). Procedure involves 3 small incisions on the right chest, use of camera and scope to remove the nodule and a small portion of lung. Procedure duration approximately 1.5 hours under general anesthesia.
    *   **Post-operative Plan:** Anticipate hospital admission for one night. Chest tube placement post-operatively, to be removed at bedside the following day. Anticipate discharge on post-operative day 1.
    *   **Patient Education:** Discussed the CT findings, the rationale for surgical removal given smoking history, details of the VATS procedure, anticipated hospital course, and potential differential diagnoses (cancer/inflammatory). Patient understands the plan but remains scared, reassurance provided.
2.  **Rheumatoid Arthritis:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue current methotrexate therapy as prescribed.
    *   **Follow-up:** Continue routine follow-up with Rheumatologist as previously established.

Patient agrees with the recommended plan. Will proceed with scheduling tests and surgery."

[patient] yeah yes
[doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all
[patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid
[doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches
[patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach
[doctor] great
[patient] starting in april so
[doctor] alright well
[patient] how long
[doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly
[patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out

Right ankle injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jerry Cook is a 45-year-old male who presents today with a right ankle injury.

The patient sustained an injury to the right ankle while playing basketball with his son. He reports he landed awkwardly and twisted his right ankle after jumping to make a layup. His pain is primarily located along the lateral aspect of the right ankle. He notes bruising and swelling. The patient is able to weight-bear while standing. He experiences pain and feelings of instability within the ankle while ambulating and is concerned for further injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works from home and plans to coach his son’s basketball team in 04/2022. He enjoys working out and reports he recently resumed engaging in a consistent gym routine.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain and instability.
Skin: Reports right ankle bruising and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Brisk capillary refill.
SKIN: No epidermolysis. Intact.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Exquisite tenderness laterally. Mild tenderness over the medial deltoid region. Swelling on the lateral side of the ankle. No horrible malalignment.

RESULTS

X-rays, including AP, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle, were obtained in the office and reviewed today. These demonstrate a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level. There is no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Right lateral malleolar fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options. Recommendation was made for an open reduction internal fixation of the right ankle. We discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as the postoperative recovery period following surgery. I advised that it will be 3 months before he can resume his exercise routine. In the meantime, I will prescribe meloxicam to reduce swelling. I recommended he ice and elevate the ankle as well. He will be given crutches to assist with ambulation.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right ankle injury.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Jerry Cook is a 45-year-old male presenting today with pain and instability in his right ankle following an injury sustained while playing basketball with his son earlier today. He reports going up for a layup and landing awkwardly after being fouled, causing his ankle to roll and twist. He describes the pain as located primarily on the outside (lateral aspect) of the ankle. He notes visible bruising and swelling in the area. He reports difficulty walking due to pain and a feeling that the ankle does not feel ""solid"" or stable, expressing concern about potentially injuring it further. He is concerned this injury will disrupt his recent return to a consistent gym routine and his plan to coach his son's basketball team starting in April.

**Past Medical History:** None mentioned.

aci,D2N125,"[patient] miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male
[doctor] how're you doing doctor cruz nice to see you today
[patient] good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor
[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you
[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that
[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area
[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face
[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face
[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face
[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it
[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes
[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it
[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you
[doctor] pain excess
[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work
[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon
[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain
[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
[patient] sure
[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
[doctor] yep
[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
[patient] okay
[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
[patient] okay
[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
[patient] sure
[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it
[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up
[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
[patient] great i'll see you then
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided facial pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Denies vision changes or weakness in right eye.
HENT: Reports right sided facial pain. Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.

Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat
Bilateral finger rub test is negative.
- Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.

RESULTS

MRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Trigeminal neuralgia.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.
- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient’s pharmacy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right-sided facial pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Edwards is a 54-year-old male presenting for evaluation of right-sided facial pain. He describes the pain as stabbing and shooting, located specifically in the right cheekbone area. He reports experiencing this pain for approximately 2-3 months, noting a slow onset initially, but now occurring in distinct episodes. The pain is severe, rated as 10/10 during episodes, and described as excruciating, like being stabbed with an ice pick. Episodes typically last for a few minutes, though occasionally up to an hour. Certain temperatures (cold) and sensory stimuli like wind seem to trigger the pain. He has tried ibuprofen, Motrin, and Tiger Balm without relief. He denies any associated sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the affected area *initially*, denies weakness on the right side of his face (notes symmetric smile), and denies vision changes. The pain is strictly limited to the right side of his face, with no similar symptoms on the left side or elsewhere. He reports occasional headaches but states they are different from this facial pain and are relieved by Tylenol. He denies any history of multiple sclerosis or brain tumors. He was referred by his family doctor.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** No other symptoms mentioned.
*   **HEENT:** Reports severe right-sided facial pain. Denies left-sided facial pain. Denies vision changes or eye weakness.
*   **Neurological:** Reports occasional headaches distinct from facial pain. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling *initially*. Denies facial weakness. Denies history of MS or brain tumors.

**Past Medical History:** None mentioned other than seeing a family doctor.
**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.
**Family History:** None mentioned.
**Social History:** None mentioned.
**Medications:** Patient reports trying ibuprofen, Motrin, Tylenol, and Tiger Balm for pain relief, none effective for the facial pain. No prescribed medications mentioned.
**Allergies:** None mentioned.

O:
**Physical Exam:**
*   **Cranial Nerves:**
    *   Extraocular movements intact bilaterally (followed finger).
    *   Facial symmetry noted with smile (teeth symmetric).
    *   Hearing intact bilaterally (finger rub test).
    *   Light touch sensation testing of the face performed: Patient reports decreased sensation (numbness) on the right side compared to the left.
    *   Pinprick sensation testing of the face performed: Patient reports dull sensation on the right side, sharp sensation on the left side.

**Results:**
*   **MRI Head:** Reviewed today. Demonstrates a small blood vessel abutting and potentially pinching the right trigeminal nerve.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Trigeminal Neuralgia, right side:** This diagnosis is strongly supported by the patient's classic presentation of severe, episodic, shooting/stabbing pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve (right cheekbone area), triggered by sensory stimuli (temperature, wind). Physical exam findings of reported sensory changes (decreased light touch, dull pinprick) on the affected side, although subjective, are consistent with nerve involvement. The MRI finding of vascular compression of the right trigeminal nerve provides objective evidence for the likely etiology of his symptoms. The root cause is assessed to be the compression of the trigeminal nerve by the blood vessel.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Trigeminal Neuralgia:**
    *   **Medical Treatment:** Initiate pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain. Discussed options including gabapentin and Tegretol (carbamazepine). Decision made to start Tegretol. Prescription for Tegretol to be sent to the patient's pharmacy.
    *   **Patient Education:** Discussed the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and the likely cause (nerve compression). Explained the rationale for using nerve-specific medications like Tegretol. Reviewed potential common side effects of Tegretol including memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. Discussed the risk of dermatologic reactions, particularly in individuals of East Asian descent, and the potential need for genetic testing to assess this risk.
    *   **Surgical Options:** Briefly discussed surgical decompression as a potential treatment option if medication is ineffective, but agreed that medication is the first-line approach and surgery is not recommended at this time.
    *   **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 1 month to assess response to Tegretol therapy and discuss further management if needed.
    *   **Patient Agreement:** Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan to start Tegretol and follow up in one month."

Right knee injury

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. Her injury was sustained while skiing in Vermont last weekend after she caught her ski when coming off of the lift and fell. She reports a pop in her knee at the time of injury and has been experiencing pain since that time. Due to her fall she was unable to weight bear and had to be taken down by the ski patrol. She locates her pain to the lateral aspect of her knee and also describes the feeling of instability as well as buckling. At this time she is experiencing difficulty with knee flexion; however, she states this was not a problem immediately after the injury. Full knee extension is also quite painful for her. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes. She is currently utilizing crutches for ambulation which were provided to her by the ski patrol. In terms of pain control, she is taking ibuprofen which is providing some relief.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports she is otherwise healthy and denies a history of high blood pressure or diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports she is very active with skiing and taking care of her 4-year-old twins. She mentions that she would like to get back into running at some point. She states that her husband is home with her, but he also works a job where he has gone quite a bit.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports she is taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and limited range of motion.
Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in toes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: The patient is ambulating with crutches.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear to auscultation.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Edema and effusion noted. Pain with palpation of the lateral knee. Decreased flexion and extension. Positive Lachman's. Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. No ankle edema.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken today. These reveal no bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible ACL tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible ACL tear. In the meantime, I have advised her to continue taking ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. She will also be placed into a brace for increased knee support.

[doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately
[patient] it hurts it hurts
[doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
[patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
[doctor] no not by any means i am saying
[patient] pain i have a lot of pain
[doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
[patient] said it might be broken
[doctor] what
[patient] pamela said it might be broken
[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
[patient] i ca n't go to work like this
[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay any other questions
[patient] not right now
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Neck pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brandon Green is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. His pain began when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 02/2022 when he was on his way home from a pain clinic. The patient notes that he has been in 4 motor vehicle accidents; however, he notes that he was fine after the first two accidents, but the third motor vehicle accident is when his neck and back pain began. He states that he was in therapy following the second accident and had surgery after his third accident. The patient was seen at a pain clinic secondary to neck and back pain. He was prescribed fentanyl; however, he has not received a prescription for several weeks. Today, he reports that his pain is a 12 out of 10. He describes his pain as sharp and incapacitating with stiffness and pain. The patient also reports headaches, occasional dizziness. He denies any recent visual disturbances. He also reports numbness in his left arm and right leg. The patient also reports spasms throughout his body. He states that he has been experiencing fatigue since the accident. He notes that he is unable to work with this much pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fatigue.
Eyes: Denies any recent visual disturbances.
Musculoskeletal: Reports neck and back pain, and occasional swelling and bruising of the neck.
Neurological: Reports headaches, dizziness, spasms, and numbness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: No lacerations.
MSK: Examination of the cervical spine: Pain on palpation on the bony process and muscle. Moderate ROM. No bruising or edema noted.

RESULTS

X-rays of the neck reveal no fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Neck sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommended an MRI for further evaluation. I have also prescribed the patient Robaxin 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours to treat his pain. I have also advised him to utilize ice, a heating pad, IcyHot, or Biofreeze on his neck as needed. I have also provided him with a home exercise program to work on his range of motion. I advised the patient that he will not be able to work until we have the MRI results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me after his MRI for results.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Neck pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Brandon Green is a male presenting today for evaluation of neck pain. He reports the onset of his current neck pain following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in February of this year. This is one of multiple MVAs he has been involved in. He states he was fine after the first two accidents, but experienced neck and back pain after the third, which required surgery. He was previously seen at a pain clinic for neck and back pain and was prescribed fentanyl, but has not had a prescription for several weeks. Since the most recent MVA in February, he describes his neck pain as sharp and incapacitating, rating it a 12 out of 10 in severity. He reports significant stiffness and pain with movement. Associated symptoms include headaches, occasional dizziness, numbness in his left arm and right leg, and spasms throughout his body. He reports experiencing fatigue since the accident. He states the pain is severe enough that he is unable to work. He denies recent visual disturbances. He reports sometimes experiencing bruising and swelling in the neck area, though not present today.

**Past Medical History:** History of multiple motor vehicle accidents, chronic neck and back pain, previous therapy for pain, previous surgery after third MVA.
**Past Surgical History:** Surgery after third MVA (specifics not mentioned).
**Social History:** Unable to work due to pain.
**Medications:** None currently prescribed (previously on fentanyl, no current prescription).
**Allergies:** Not discussed.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Reports fatigue.
*   **HEENT:** Reports headaches, occasional dizziness. Denies recent visual disturbances.
*   **Neurological:** Reports numbness in left arm and right leg, spasms.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports severe neck and back pain, stiffness, pain with movement. Reports occasional bruising and swelling of the neck (not observed on exam today).

O:
**Vitals:** Not discussed.
**Physical Exam:**
*   **Cervical Spine:** Pain on palpation of the bony process and muscle. Moderate range of motion noted. No bruising, swelling, or laceration observed on exam today.
**Imaging:**
*   **Cervical Spine X-ray:** Performed prior to visit. Reviewed by clinician, no fracture identified.

A:
**Problem List:**
1.  **Neck Sprain:** Acute on chronic neck pain, severe, following motor vehicle accident in February. Assessment based on history of trauma, patient-reported severe pain, stiffness, spasms, and associated neurological symptoms (numbness, dizziness, headaches), in the setting of a negative cervical spine X-ray for fracture. Given the severity of symptoms, history of multiple MVAs, and patient report of potential fracture (per previous provider), further imaging is warranted to rule out more significant injury and evaluate soft tissues.
2.  Chronic Pain Syndrome/History of Multiple MVAs: Relevant context for current presentation and management approach.
3.  Inability to Work: Directly related to current pain severity.

P:
**Neck Sprain/Pain Management:**
*   **Medication:** Prescribe Robaxin 1500mg to be taken every 6 to 8 hours for muscle relaxation and pain relief.
*   **Supportive Care:** Advised patient to use ice on the neck if experiencing bruising or swelling. Recommended considering heat pad, IcyHot, or Biofreeze if Robaxin is insufficient for pain control.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Referral planned.
*   **Home Exercise Program:** Provided sheet with exercises to perform daily in the morning to improve range of motion.
*   **Diagnostic Imaging:** Order MRI of the cervical spine for more thorough evaluation of bony and soft tissue structures, especially given symptom severity and history.
*   **Work Status:** Provide note for patient to be off work until MRI results are available due to incapacitating pain and limited mobility.
*   **Pain Management Referral:** Discussed potential referral to Pain Medicine if pain remains severe or complex, particularly given history of fentanyl use.
**Follow-up:**
*   Return to clinic after completion of the MRI for review of results and further management planning."

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Beverly Ortiz is a 24-year-old female patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. She is here today for her yearly exam.

Diabetes mellitus type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: Her blood glucose levels have been uncontrolled. She is still taking metformin twice a day, but does admit to dietary indiscretion with an increase in her sweets intake.. Her most recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated.
• Medical Treatment: Continue metformin twice a day.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to check her fasting blood glucose levels each morning and call them in about 2 weeks. She will follow up in about 2 months, at which time we will discuss further treatment recommendations.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Appears to be relatively stable.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 10 mg once daily.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Annual exam.

**History of Present Illness:** Beverly Ortiz is a 24-year-old female presenting for her annual physical examination. She reports generally doing well. She recently began working at a bakery this summer and finds herself snacking frequently and eating more desserts than usual due to proximity to treats. She believes this dietary change is impacting her blood sugar control. She reports her blood sugars have been ""up and down"" but states she has been taking her prescribed metformin medication consistently without missing doses. Despite the blood sugar fluctuations, she reports her blood pressure has been good and stable. She reports sleeping well, getting a full eight hours per night. She denies any concerns about self-harm.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
*   Hypertension

**Social History:**
*   New employment at a bakery since summer, leading to increased snacking and dessert consumption.

**Medications:**
*   Metformin (frequency: twice a day, dose not specified in transcript)
*   Lisinopril 10 mg daily

**Allergies:** Not discussed in transcript.

**Review of Systems:**
*   General: Reports doing well overall.
*   Endocrine: Reports blood sugars are ""up and down"", believes related to diet. Reports taking metformin as prescribed.
*   Cardiovascular: Reports blood pressure has been good/stable. Reports taking lisinopril as prescribed.
*   Neurological: Denies concerns about self-harm.
*   Psychiatric: Denies concerns about self-harm.
*   Sleep: Reports sleeping well, getting 8 hours.
*   Other systems reviewed by nurse and reported as negative per patient confirmation.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Blood pressure: Stable/Normal (as reported by clinician based on monitor display).
**Physical Exam:** (As described by clinician)
*   General: Essentially normal.
*   Cardiovascular: Regular rate. Grade 2 systolic ejection murmur noted (unchanged from previous exams). Good pulses.
*   Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
*   Neck: No carotid bruits, no thyromegaly.
*   Extremities: No edema.
*   Neurological: Grip strength equal bilaterally. Neurologically intact. Can feel touch in upper and lower extremities.
**Laboratory Data:**
*   Hemoglobin A1c: Elevated (specific value not stated in transcript).

A:
1.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled:** Based on patient report of fluctuating blood sugars (S) and elevated Hemoglobin A1c (O). Patient attributes poor control to recent dietary changes (increased snacking/sweets) related to new job (S), despite reported adherence to metformin (S). Goal A1c < 7, preferably < 6.
2.  **Hypertension, stable:** Based on patient report of good blood pressure (S) and clinician report of stable/normal blood pressure (O) while on current medication (S).

P:
1.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Metformin twice daily. No change in dosage at this time as uncontrolled sugars are believed to be diet-related.
    *   **Diet:** Strongly encouraged to reduce snacking and decrease consumption of sweets, particularly while at work in the bakery.
    *   **Monitoring:** Check fasting blood glucose levels every morning.
    *   **Follow-up:** Call in fasting blood sugar readings in approximately two weeks. Return for follow-up appointment in two months to re-evaluate blood sugar control and A1c. If blood sugars have not improved by the follow-up visit, consider adding another medication.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Lisinopril 10 mg daily. Medication appears to be effective in maintaining stable blood pressure. No changes needed at this time.
    *   **Follow-up:** Continue monitoring as part of overall health management.

Back pain.

HPI:

Ms. Lee is a 40-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of back pain. She states she was at a birthday party and she ran her back into the railing of the staircase and twisted her back. She denies any pain radiating down her legs. Lying flat and twisting motions aggravate the pain. She is currently taking ibuprofen.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Ibuprofen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Anxiety.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Lumbar fusion

EXAM

Examination of the back shows range of motion without pain. Straight leg raise is negative. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the lumbar spine show no obvious signs of acute fracture. Evidence of a prior lumbar fusion with hardware in good position.

IMPRESSION

Lumbar spine strain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended ice and heat. She will continue with Motrin 800 mg 3 times a day with food. She will follow up with me as needed.","S:

Back pain.

HPI:
Ms. Lee is a 40-year-old female presenting with acute onset back pain. The pain began recently at a birthday party when she twisted and fell, striking her back against a staircase railing. She describes the pain as located more on the right side of her back. She denies any pain shooting down her legs. The pain is aggravated by lying flat and twisting motions. She is currently taking ibuprofen for the pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Anxiety

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Lumbar fusion (year not specified)

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Ibuprofen (dose/frequency not specified by patient)
Medication for anxiety (name/dose/frequency not specified)

ROS:
Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain and stiffness with rotation. Denies pain shooting down legs.
Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in legs.

O:
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Back: Pain noted with twisting motion during examination.
Straight Leg Raise: Negative bilaterally.
Neurological: Sensation intact in bilateral lower extremities. Denies pain shooting down legs with straight leg raise maneuvers.

IMAGING:
Lumbar spine X-ray: Reviewed. Shows evidence of prior lumbar fusion with hardware. No acute compression fracture or significant abnormality identified. Essentially normal exam except for the fusion.

A:
Lumbar strain: Acute onset back pain following a twisting injury and fall, localized to the right side of the back, aggravated by movement. Physical exam demonstrates pain with twisting but negative straight leg raise and intact sensation, making radiculopathy less likely. Lumbar spine X-ray shows no acute fracture or significant abnormality, ruling out bony injury as the primary cause of acute pain. This presentation is consistent with a lumbar muscle or ligamentous strain.

P:
1.  **Lumbar Strain:**
    *   Continue Motrin 800mg by mouth three times daily with food for pain and inflammation.
    *   Apply ice and heat to the affected area, alternating as desired.
    *   Encourage walking as tolerated.
    *   Discussed diagnosis, treatment plan, and expected course of recovery.
2.  **Follow-up:** Return to clinic if symptoms do not improve or worsen over the next week."

[doctor] okay .
[patient] . in my right knee .
[doctor] just in your right knee ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
[patient] yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
[doctor] and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
[patient] no , not that i can remember .
[doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?

The patient reports that her knee starts hurting after a couple of laps. She notes previously she could swim 10 laps. She denies injury or trauma to the knee.

The patient has a history of chronic back pain that has been intermittent, but right now it has been doing well. She denies pain radiating down her legs.

The patient has a history of depression, which has been going really well with medication and therapy. She is trying to get outside more and it has been helping her with her depression. She notes she is sleeping and eating well. She denies concerns about hurting herself or others.

The patient's carpal tunnel is doing really well. She has been getting full range of motion and it has felt a lot better.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Endorses right knee joint pain. Endorses chronic back pain.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Thompson is a 27 y.o. female who presents today for evaluation of right knee pain.

Chondromalacia of right patella.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been more active lately but is unaware of any injury to the knee. Her recent x-rays were normal but she did have some discomfort on exam.
• Medical Treatment: Prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg 4 times a day with food. I do want her to do some straight leg raising exercises that will strengthen her quadriceps.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to participate in physical activity that is less straining on her joints , such as swimming freestyle laps, or to stop activity all together. If her pain does not improve in a couple of weeks, she will follow up.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: This is stable and well-controlled at this time.
• Medical Treatment: She should continue swimming regularly once her knee is feeling better.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with her current regimen.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current medications.

Carpal tunnel syndrome.

[patient] yes . so , i've been eating a ton of sweets recently . with the holidays it just feels like there is always something sweet available. whether i am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when i visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable, there is always something sweet i can be eating. in the beginning i felt fine, but i have started to feel it after a couple of weeks, and this past week i just felt really light-headed and i could ... was seeing spots , really dizzy . so i went into the emergency room and they said i had a high blood sugar . um , so i wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that , um , get checked out .

**Chief Complaint:** Evaluation of high blood sugar.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Hannah Phillips is a 52-year-old female presenting for evaluation of high blood sugar. She reports that over the past couple of weeks, she has been eating a significant amount of sweets due to holiday availability at work and family gatherings. Initially, she felt fine, but symptoms began developing. This past week, she experienced light-headedness, seeing spots, and dizziness, which prompted a visit to the emergency room. In the ER, she was diagnosed with high blood sugar and received IV fluids. She was advised to reduce sweets and return to her normal diet and routine. She notes difficulty adhering to this advice currently as she is staying with family who are avid bakers. She is seeking follow-up to address the high blood sugar.

She denies fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and burning with urination. She denies joint pain or muscle aches, clarifying that this is relative to her baseline osteoarthritis pain, which is not currently worse than usual.

She has a history of atrial fibrillation and reports feeling her heart racing only when she is anxious, otherwise denies recent palpitations. She is currently taking metoprolol 25 mg twice daily and requests a refill.

virtscribe,D2N138,"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
[patient] okay awesome .
[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[patient] okay
[doctor] all right so we've got it .
[patient] great .
[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[patient] okay sounds good .
[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, “seizure-like” reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

• Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
• Allergic rhinitis.
• Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting for her annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.
ASTHMA: She reports good control of her asthma. Due to insurance changes since her last visit in April 2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela Inhub 250/50, which she is currently using. She is prescribed one puff twice daily (morning and night) and reports it is working well. She uses her Albuterol inhaler rarely, primarily as a preventative measure before strenuous activity such as running or workouts. She denies needing Albuterol for daily activities like walking or going to the grocery store. She reports trying to reduce her daily inhaler use (Wixela) in preparation for military enlistment, which requires demonstrating a certain fitness level without inhalers. She is currently using Wixela one puff twice daily approximately 3-4 days per week, and one puff once daily on the remaining days, alternating between morning and night doses. She feels this reduced regimen is working well. She denies any urgent care or emergency room visits for breathing issues in the past year and denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues during this time. She anticipates military enlistment in early spring 2022, giving her 6-7 months to demonstrate control without inhalers.
ALLERGIC RHINITIS: She uses Zyrtec for seasonal allergy symptoms, primarily in the spring and fall, and less frequently in the summer (as needed). She is currently taking Zyrtec approximately 3 days per week when she works outside, and reports it works well to control her symptoms.
FOOD ALLERGY: She has a known peanut allergy and reports successfully avoiding peanuts. She recounts a contact exposure incident from the previous year involving cleaning an Enterprise rental car with peanuts, which caused contact hives. Since that experience, she has become more cautious, wearing long sleeves and changing gloves frequently when cleaning cars. She believes she may have encountered cars with peanuts since then but avoided direct skin contact due to these precautions. She is aware of peanuts being served on airplanes. She confirms she keeps an EpiPen with her. She also has a history of tree nut allergy but reports tolerating almonds and cashews. She recalls eating almonds without issue after a previous discussion about potential tolerance but generally tends to avoid all tree nuts if possible.
INTERVAL HISTORY: She reports developing a habit of vaping and smoking over the past year but is actively trying to quit and has significantly cut down her use. She owns a nebulizer but has not needed refills and has not used it recently, recalling using it previously for bronchitis or a few times as a child. Written consent for Dax documentation was obtained today.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Asthma
Allergic Rhinitis
Food Allergy (Peanut, Tree Nut)

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Current tobacco smoking and vaping (trying to quit).

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation, 1 puff 2 times daily (as prescribed, patient reports variable use).
Proair HFA, as needed.
EpiPen, as needed.
Zyrtec 10 mg, as needed (over the counter).

ALLERGIES:
Peanuts (anaphylaxis)
Montelukast sodium (""seizure-like"" reaction)

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Reports feeling pretty good.
Respiratory: Denies urgent care/ER visits or prednisone use for breathing issues in the past year. Reports reduced daily inhaler use and rare Albuterol use with exertion.
HEENT: Reports seasonal allergy symptoms controlled with Zyrtec.

O:
Vitals: Not recorded/discussed in transcript.
Physical Exam:
Ears: Look good, little bit of wax on both sides.
Mouth: Good.
Nose: Good.
Lungs: Sound terrific.
Heart: Very good.
Tests:
Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score: 21.
Spirometry: Results are about the same as a couple years ago, and actually look a bit better than the test performed in 2019 (which was attributed to wildfire smoke at the time).
Food Skin Test: Sensitivities include peanuts.

A:
1. Asthma, Moderate Persistent, Uncomplicated.
20-year-old female with well-controlled asthma presenting for annual follow-up. Patient reports reduced need for daily inhaled corticosteroid/LABA (Wixela) and rare use of rescue inhaler (Albuterol) only with strenuous exertion. This aligns with her goal of military enlistment requiring fitness without inhalers. Objective data supports good control with an ACT score of 21 and spirometry results stable/improved compared to prior testing. Discussed stepping down therapy based on good control and current guidelines suggesting reduced daily ICS use in well-controlled patients, potentially using ICS PRN for illness or environmental triggers (e.g., smoke season). Decision made to trial stepping down to a single inhaled corticosteroid agent.
2. Allergic Rhinitis, Seasonal.
Patient reports seasonal symptoms primarily in spring/fall, controlled with Zyrtec used as needed, currently about 3 days per week when working outside. Symptoms are well-managed with current regimen.
3. Peanut Allergy, Anaphylaxis Risk.
Patient has a history of anaphylaxis and contact hives with peanut exposure. Reports strict avoidance and increased caution following a contact exposure incident last year. Keeps EpiPen with her.
4. Tree Nut Allergy (Almond/Cashew Tolerated), Avoidance.
Patient has a history of tree nut allergy but reports tolerating almonds and cashews without reaction. Despite this, she prefers to avoid all tree nuts if possible.
5. Tobacco/Vaping Use.
Patient reports new onset vaping/smoking habit in the past year but is actively trying to quit and has reduced use. This may potentially impact respiratory health.

P:
1. Asthma, Moderate Persistent, Uncomplicated:
    - Discontinue Wixela Inhub 250/50. Patient instructed to keep the inhaler in case the new medication is not tolerated or effective.
    - Start Alvesco 80 mcg, 2 puffs by mouth twice daily. Prescription sent to Kaiser Permanente Broadway pharmacy.
    - Continue Albuterol HFA as needed for shortness of breath or prior to strenuous activity.
    - Patient education provided regarding rationale for stepping down therapy (good control, military goals) and potential future strategy of using ICS PRN for illness/smoke season based on newer guidelines.
    - Follow-up: Return in 4 months for re-check of asthma control, repeat ACT score, and repeat spirometry. Sooner if needed for worsening symptoms.
2. Allergic Rhinitis, Seasonal:
    - Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed, purchased over the counter.
3. Peanut Allergy, Anaphylaxis Risk:
    - Continue strict avoidance of peanuts.
    - Refill EpiPen (new set for the year) to Kaiser Permanente Broadway pharmacy.
4. Tree Nut Allergy (Almond/Cashew Tolerated), Avoidance:
    - Continue avoidance as patient prefers.
5. Tobacco/Vaping Use:
    - Acknowledged patient's effort to quit. (No specific intervention discussed in transcript)."

[doctor] hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm fine , thank you .
[doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .
[patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .
[doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .
[patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .
[doctor] do you have a family history of this ?
[patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .
[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[patient] uh , yes i am .
[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] um , every day .
[doctor] awesome .
[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?
[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[patient] good to hear .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[patient] nope . nowhere .
[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY

Several family members positive for hypertension.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg
Amlodipine 10 mg daily.

Physical Examination

Cardiovascular
Normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.

Pulmonary/Chest
Breath sounds normal. 

Abdominal
There is no tenderness.

Musculoskeletal
There is no edema.

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old male presenting for evaluation of long-standing hypertension and a recent episode of palpitations.
He reports a visit to the emergency room in March for high blood pressure and palpitations. He attributes this episode to a potential panic attack, noting he had consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach that morning. He denies any recurrence of palpitations since that time.
He has a history of hypertension since he was young and reports a strong family history of the condition. He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication, Benicar HCT (hydrochlorothiazide component), approximately one month ago. He is also currently taking amlodipine 10 mg daily.
He monitors his blood pressure at home daily, typically in the morning upon waking. His recent readings have been ranging from 146 to 155 systolic. He notes he is ""trying to back off"" his salt intake and feels he is doing well with this. He also tries to walk on his treadmill when he can.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY: Several family members have high blood pressure.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Reports efforts to reduce salt intake and walk on treadmill for exercise.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg daily (patient refers to as ""combo med"" and ""water pill"")
Amlodipine 10 mg daily

ALLERGIES: No allergies mentioned in transcript.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Denies dizziness when hydrated (discussed in context of dehydration risk).
Cardiovascular: Denies recurrent palpitations.
Respiratory: No respiratory symptoms mentioned.
Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain on palpation during exam.
Musculoskeletal: Denies swelling in ankles/feet during exam.

O:
VITAL SIGNS: Not documented in transcript.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
General: Appears well (implied by conversation flow).
Cardiovascular: Heart sounds normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal pulses (as verbalized by clinician).
Pulmonary: Breath sounds normal (as verbalized by clinician).
Abdomen: No tenderness on palpation (as verbalized by clinician).
Extremities: No edema noted in ankles and feet (as verbalized by clinician).

LABORATORY/IMAGING:
Thyroid profile from 03/01/2021 (requested to be copied forward, results not discussed).
Potassium 4.0 one week ago (as discussed by clinician).

A:
1. Resistant Hypertension: 49-year-old male with long-standing hypertension and positive family history, currently on two antihypertensive medications (amlodipine 10mg daily, Benicar HCT 40/25mg daily) at what is stated to be maximal doses, with persistently elevated home systolic blood pressure readings ranging from 146-155. This meets criteria for resistant hypertension. Differential considerations include inadequate lifestyle modifications (salt intake, exercise), medication non-adherence (less likely given home monitoring), or secondary causes of hypertension (e.g., hyperaldosteronism, parathyroid issues) as discussed by the clinician. Potassium level one week ago was 4.0, providing some buffer for potential electrolyte shifts with diuretic therapy.
2. Palpitations: Resolved episode in March, potentially related to caffeine intake and fasting, attributed by patient to panic attack. Denies recurrence.

P:
1. Resistant Hypertension:
    *   Add Spironolactone: Initiate spironolactone (dosage not specified in transcript) to current regimen.
    *   Monitoring: Requires close monitoring of potassium and sodium levels due to risk of electrolyte imbalance with combined hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone. Also monitor for signs of dehydration (e.g., dizziness upon standing).
    *   Follow-up Labs/BP Check: Schedule follow-up appointment in two weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel (BMP) to assess electrolytes (potassium, sodium) and renal function.
    *   Patient Education:
        *   Discussed potential side effects of spironolactone, including electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, dizziness, and rare risk of gynecomastia (tenderness, swelling, or enlargement of breasts; advised to discontinue medication and notify clinician if this occurs).
        *   Emphasized importance of adequate hydration.
        *   Counseled on the significance of controlling blood pressure to prevent long-term complications such as heart enlargement, heart failure, kidney failure, and stroke.
        *   Reinforced lifestyle modifications:
            *   Salt restriction: Goal intake <2000 mg/day, ideally 1500 mg/day.
            *   Exercise: Aim for 30 minutes of treadmill walking most days, noting potential for 7-10 point BP reduction.
            *   Diet: Provided information on the DASH eating plan and encouraged adherence.
        *   Recommended resources: American Heart Association website (heart.org) for further information on blood pressure management, diet, and exercise.
    *   Future Plan: If blood pressure remains uncontrolled on the current regimen including spironolactone, the next step would be referral to a resistant hypertension clinic for evaluation of secondary causes and potential procedural interventions (e.g., renal denervation). Carvedilol was mentioned as a potential alternative medication but is currently being avoided due to risk of erectile dysfunction; this risk was discussed with the patient.
2. Palpitations: No specific plan needed at this time given resolution and patient's likely etiology. Patient advised to report any recurrence.

Follow-up: Schedule appointment in 2 weeks for BP check and BMP."

[patient] i'm okay .
[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .
[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid “heavy foods,” but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful. The patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS

• Gastrointestinal: Positive nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Alert and cooperative, appears stated age.

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Normoactive bowel sounds.

ASSESSMENT

• Irritable bowel syndrome

Brittany Edwards is a 32-year-old established patient who returned today to discuss management of IBS and functional abdominal pain made worse by high stress, poor eating habits, and poor sleeping habits.

PLAN

I have encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting a neuromodulator, such as Elavil 25 mg at bedtime for IBS. She can use Bentyl 20 mg as needed 30-45 minutes before eating out at a restaurant. She can also use Zofran as needed for nausea. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy fatty foods and alcohol consumption.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow up for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female returning for follow up of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was last seen in August 2019 and diagnosed with IBS, previously treated with Bentyl. She had a prior prescription for Reglan from the ER for nausea, which she used as needed. Previous recommendations included starting low-dose fiber (Citrucel), probiotics, Bentyl up to four times daily for cramping, discontinuing Reglan, and using Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed previously but not initiated.

Ms. Edwards reports her symptoms have not been well controlled. She notes flares of both upper and lower abdominal symptoms, including cramping, sharp pains, and nausea. She reports these symptoms are aggravated by eating out, particularly spicy or fatty foods and alcohol. She specifically mentions experiencing diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol, although she states the alfredo normally does not bother her. She consumes 2 drinks (tequila or brown liquor) or occasionally a martini when out. She has been avoiding ""heavy foods"" but ate fried chicken today without significant issues, noting the importance of portion size. She reports drinking more water instead of sodas, which has been helpful. On normal days, she reports having 2-3 formed bowel movements per day, but experiences diarrhea after eating out or drinking. She states she has not been using the Citrucel regularly.

A:
1. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, currently in flare.
- 32-year-old female with established IBS presenting with increased symptoms including cramping, sharp abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, particularly aggravated by dietary triggers such as spicy/fatty foods and alcohol consumption when eating out. Physical exam is reassuring with a soft, non-tender abdomen and normoactive bowel sounds, consistent with functional abdominal pain rather than acute inflammatory or obstructive process. Symptoms are impacting quality of life and warrant adjustment of management strategy.

P:
1. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):
- **Medication Management:**
    - **Elavil (Amitriptyline):** Initiate Elavil 25 mg by mouth every night at bedtime for long-term management of gut sensitivity and to potentially reduce frequency/severity of flares. Discussed potential side effect of sleepiness. Prescription sent to pharmacy.
    - **Bentyl (Dicyclomine):** Continue Bentyl 20 mg tablets as needed for intestinal cramping. Advised to take 1 tablet 30-45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant, and may repeat up to 4 times daily as needed. Refill provided.
    - **Zofran (Ondansetron):** Continue Zofran as needed for nausea. Encouraged focusing on trigger reduction first before using Zofran.
    - **Citrucel (Methylcellulose):** Restart Citrucel (tablet form) twice daily for regularity.
- **Dietary and Lifestyle Modifications:**
    - Emphasized avoidance of known triggers, specifically greasy/fatty foods, sugary drinks, and alcohol, particularly when eating out.
    - Encouraged watching portion sizes.
    - Encouraged continued increased water intake.
- **Patient Education:** Provided rationale for starting Elavil (working on brain chemicals affecting gut sensitivity) and timing of Bentyl use. Reinforced importance of identifying and avoiding dietary triggers.
- **Follow-up:** Follow up via MyChart message in approximately one month to assess for side effects or issues with Elavil and review symptom status. Patient advised to call sooner if needed."
virtscribe,D2N141,"[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[patient] thanks
[patient_guest] thank you .
[doctor] all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings .
[doctor] let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 .
[doctor] mr . watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice .

Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said “I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.” Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

PAST HISTORY

Urinary incontinence.
Adult hydrocephalus.
Gait impairment.
Cognitive impairment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.
• Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.
• Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.
• Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

VITALS

Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.

Head and Face
The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.

Neurological
Mental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

• Adult hydrocephalus.
• Gait impairment.
• Urinary incontinence and urgency.
• Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 3 months.","S:
**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:** Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns for follow-up of adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, who assists with providing history. The patient was first seen in May 2020, presenting with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. Adult hydrocephalus was diagnosed via spinal catheter protocol in June 2020. He underwent shunt surgery on August 1, 2020, receiving a Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration, initially programmed at level 2.0.

Since surgery, the patient reports no hospitalizations or other illnesses. Regarding his symptoms, his daughter reports improved walking, stating he can now walk to the dining room without assistance, which he could not do previously, though he still requires help at times. Bladder control initially improved but has since leveled off, and he continues to wear diapers. He denies issues with sores from diapers or decreased/painful urination. Cognition is reported as improved by both the patient and daughter; the patient feels less lost in conversation, and his daughter feels she can have a ""normal conversation"" with him again. He denies headaches, pain at the shunt site, or abdominal pain.

Slight improvement from initial score of 23/30 (calculations) and 24/30 (spelling), where he recalled no words with cuing and only 1 with multiple choice.
    *   **Gait/Balance:** Tinetti assessment performed without assistive device. Gait score 6-8/12, Balance score 12/16. Total score 18-20/28. Slight improvement from initial score of 15-17/28.
    *   **Cranial Nerves:** Pupils equal, EOMs intact, face symmetric, no dysarthria.
    *   **Motor:** Normal bulk and strength.

**IMAGING:**
*   **CT Head (10/15/2020):** Frontal horn span at foramen of Monro 4.6 cm. Third ventricular contour flat with span 10 mm. Physician reading notes a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with a tiny subdural collection, which was not noted by the radiologist (who reported no extra-axial fluid collections). Substantial small vessel ischemic change is also noted.

A:
**ASSESSMENT:**
1.  **Adult Hydrocephalus:** 86-year-old male, 3 months status post VP shunt placement for adult hydrocephalus. Patient and daughter report subjective improvement in gait and cognition, with some initial improvement in bladder control that has plateaued. Objective findings include slight improvement in MMSE and Tinetti scores compared to baseline. Shunt site is clean and intact. CT head shows stable ventricular size but notes a small right frontal/subdural fluid collection not documented by radiology. This collection is not believed to be symptomatic given the patient's lack of headaches or pain and overall improvement.
2.  **Gait Impairment:** Improved subjectively per daughter, objectively slight improvement on Tinetti gait/balance scores, but still demonstrates slow coordination and requires assistance at times.
3.  **Cognitive Impairment:** Improved subjectively per patient and daughter, objectively slight improvement on MMSE score, particularly in memory recall with cuing.
4.  **Urinary Incontinence:** Subjectively improved initially but has plateaued; patient continues to wear diapers. Denies associated symptoms like sores or painful urination.

The patient has demonstrated overall improvement in symptoms attributed to hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. The small fluid collection seen on CT is noted but not considered clinically significant at this time given the patient's presentation. The question of driving ability was discussed, and based on current speed of movement/coordination, passing a driver safety evaluation is considered unlikely at this time, though further improvement over 9-12 months is possible.

P:
**PLAN:**
1.  **Adult Hydrocephalus:** Continue current management. Given the noted improvement and the presence of the small fluid collection on CT, the shunt setting will remain at 2.0 for the next 2-3 months. Discussed with patient and daughter that the fluid collection is likely not symptomatic and not a cause for immediate concern.
2.  **Gait/Cognitive Impairment:** Continue to monitor for further improvement.
3.  **Urinary Incontinence:** Continue current management with diapers. Patient denies complications.
4.  **Driving:** Discussed patient's question regarding ability to drive. Explained that based on current motor speed and coordination, passing a driver safety evaluation is unlikely now. Advised that significant improvement over 9-12 months could potentially change this assessment. Patient may enroll in a driver safety program independently. Emphasized patient safety as the priority.
5.  **Follow-up:** Return for follow-up in 3 months to reassess symptoms, neurological status, and consider potential shunt adjustments if indicated and symptoms continue to improve. Patient instructed to schedule the appointment at the front desk."

[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
[patient] all right that sounds good .
[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Amanda Taylor is an 72-year-old woman who presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

Mrs. Taylor admits to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week and is interested in Naltrexone injections. She acknowledges that her blood pressure would likely improve if she stopped alcohol consumption. She is checking her blood pressure in the morning and evening, stating it is higher at night but will improve after sitting for a few minutes. She is averaged 135-145 or 150 over 95-110.

She experienced side effects from lisinopril, such as headaches, “swooshing” in her left ear, and lethargy. She took half a dose and did not experience the side effects.

ASSESSMENT

• Alcohol use disorder.
• Hypertension.

Mrs. Taylor presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

PLAN

Alcohol use disorder
I will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.

Hypertension
She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.

Recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.

Call the clinic with any questions. Make follow up appointment week of June 14th.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up for hypertension and discussion of alcohol use disorder treatment.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Amanda Taylor is a 72-year-old woman presenting for follow-up of hypertension and to discuss treatment options for alcohol use disorder. Her medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At her last visit on April 16th, her blood pressure was 130/90. Following an initial presentation of 150/100, she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. Prior CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

Patient reports struggling with not drinking alcohol. She states her last drink was on Monday, two days prior to the visit. She reports drinking hard alcohol 4-5 times per week for a while. She acknowledges that stopping drinking would help her blood pressure.

She reports taking her blood pressure medications. She is taking the full dose of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. However, she is only taking half of the prescribed lisinopril (10 mg daily) because the first time she took the full 20 mg dose, she felt lethargic and tired, experienced headaches, and a ""swooshing"" sensation in her left ear. She states she felt much better on the half dose and did not experience these side effects. She takes her medications in the morning.

She is checking her blood pressure at home. She reports seeing lower numbers in the morning compared to the evening. In the evenings, she reports readings anywhere from 130-145 or 150 systolic over 95-100 diastolic. She notes that if she sits for a while before taking it in the evening, the reading goes down, similar to when she is in the clinic. Morning readings are generally more normal.

She denies chest tightness, pressure, shortness of breath, fever, cough, or sore throat. She denies recent travel or exposure to coronavirus. She received her coronavirus vaccine on February 9th.

Full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.

The patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.

Ms. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Genitourinary
Pelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.

ASSESSMENT

• Screening for sexually transmitted disease.

PLAN

Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing. We will screen her today for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. Patient is high risk due to an abnormal pap smear in the past and the recent discovery of her sexual partner having multiple partners for some period of time. We will call the patient with the results of the laboratory testing.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease (STI) testing. She reports symptoms of discomfort, a change in vaginal discharge, and odor, which she first noticed last week. She states the discharge is different in color and consistency than usual. Approximately one week ago, she also began experiencing pain and soreness on the right side of her vagina, which has not resolved. She denies fever or chills. Her presentation is prompted by the recent discovery that her partner of three years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for approximately three months. She is concerned about potential STI exposure and desires comprehensive testing.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Patient reports a history of an abnormal Pap smear around age 20. Her most recent Pap smear approximately six months ago was normal.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Not documented in transcript.

FAMILY HISTORY: Not documented in transcript.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient is in a relationship of three years duration. Reports recent discovery of partner infidelity. Smoking, alcohol, and substance use not documented in transcript.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

Adnexa: No adnexal tenderness or masses noted.

LABS/IMAGING:
Swabs obtained for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis testing.
Blood drawn for syphilis, HIV, and Hepatitis C testing.

A:
1. Screening for Sexually Transmitted Infections.
    - Patient presents with subjective symptoms concerning for STI (change in discharge, vaginal pain) in the setting of high-risk exposure (partner infidelity with multiple partners).
    - Objective pelvic exam is reassuring with no external lesions, normal discharge appearance/smell, and absence of cervical motion or adnexal tenderness, however, this does not rule out STI.
    - Patient is considered high risk for STI acquisition given the recent discovery of her partner's multiple sexual partners and a history of a past abnormal Pap smear (though recent Pap was normal).

P:
1. Screening for Sexually Transmitted Infections:
    - Comprehensive STI testing performed today including swabs for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis, and blood draw for syphilis, HIV, and Hepatitis C.
    - Discussed high-risk status with patient.
    - Discussed testing plan and timeline for results.
    - Results: Will call patient with results when available. Patient may call the clinic in three days if she has not heard from us.
    - Follow-up: If all results are normal, follow-up will be at the next scheduled annual checkup. Return sooner for worsening symptoms or new concerns."

[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .

Rheumatoid arthritis management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Nelson is a 72-year-old male who presents today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis. He was last seen by me on 03/04/2021, where he received a steroid injection to his right knee. He continues to experience right knee pain and swelling. The pain level is 6/10. He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to ""get his bearings."" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal
Lower right extremity: Swollen right knee, slightly reduced range of motion. Skin warm to touch. Lower right leg pits with pressure.

PROCEDURE

Fluid aspiration and Steroid injection.
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained. The risks of steroid injection were explained, including but not limited to, hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia among others. Verbal consent was obtained. The right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 mL of initially clear fluid then blood-tinged fluid. Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications. Post procedure instructions were given.

ASSESSMENT

• Rheumatoid arthritis management.
• High risk medication use.
• Right knee pain.
• Lower extremity pitting edema.

PLAN

Rheumatoid arthritis management.
The patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily. He will also continue Celebrex 200 mg daily.

High-risk medication use.
The patient is currently on the high-risk medication Xeljanz. We will check his CMP levels and monitor periodically every couple of months.

Right knee pain.
He has right knee pain and swelling, with pain level 6/10. On exam today, the right knee continues to be hot, which is ongoing inflammation. We performed a fluid aspiration of the right knee today, see procedure note above. A steroid injection to the right knee was given today, see procedure note above. We will arrange for x-ray of the right knee and refer his to physical therapy.

Lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not seen his PCP. We discussed compression stockings, elevate feet, and a low salt diet. He will check with his PCP for further instructions.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right knee pain and swelling.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Tyler Nelson is a 72-year-old male presenting for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis, specifically concerning worsening right knee pain and swelling. He was last seen approximately two months ago for a right knee steroid injection, which provided relief for only a couple of weeks. He reports persistent pain, typically 6/10 on a normal day, currently 3/10. Swelling, initially limited to the knee, has extended to involve the entire right leg over the past ~2 months. He experiences significant stiffness upon standing after prolonged sitting, requiring cane use initially, though it loosens up with movement. Straightening the leg fully is painful. He uses compression socks which provide some degree of help, but swelling persists, especially around the knee. He denies recent physical therapy for this knee.

**Past Medical History:** Rheumatoid Arthritis.

**Past Surgical History:** Physical therapy for left knee ""some years ago"".

**Social History:** Enjoys salty snacks.

**Medications:**
*   Xeljanz XR 11mg daily (taking regularly)
*   Celebrex 200mg daily (started ~2 months ago, effective until swelling worsened)

**Allergies:** Not mentioned.

**Review of Systems:** (Pertinent positives based on HPI)
*   General: Pain, swelling, stiffness.
*   Musculoskeletal: Right knee and leg pain, swelling, stiffness, diminished range of motion (patient reported).

O:
**Vitals:** Not mentioned.

**Physical Exam:**
*   Right Lower Extremity: Knee is hot to touch. Range of motion slightly diminished (clinician observation). Pitting edema noted around the knee and ankle. Normal capillary refill in toes.

**Labs/Imaging:** CMP levels checked previously were ""good"" (no current values given).

**Procedure (Objective findings during procedure):**
*   Right knee fluid aspiration performed via lateral approach. 3 mL of fluid aspirated, initially clear, then blood-tinged.
*   Right knee injected with 80 mg Triamcinolone and 1 mL Lidocaine after standard prep.
*   Procedure tolerated well with no complications. Risks, benefits, and alternatives of steroid injection (including hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, transient hypoglycemia) were explained, and verbal consent was obtained.

A:
1.  **Rheumatoid Arthritis Flare, Right Knee:** Based on subjective report of worsening pain (6/10 typical), swelling extending to the entire leg, stiffness, and objective findings of a hot, swollen knee with diminished ROM and pitting edema. Aspiration yielded fluid, consistent with inflammation. Previous injection provided only temporary relief.
2.  **Lower Extremity Pitting Edema, Right Leg:** Extends from knee to ankle. Cause likely multifactorial, potentially related to inflammation from RA flare, but also discussed potential contribution of dietary salt intake. Further workup planned.
3.  **High-Risk Medication Use (Xeljanz):** Requires ongoing monitoring.

P:
1.  **Rheumatoid Arthritis Flare, Right Knee:**
    *   Procedure: Right knee fluid aspiration and steroid injection performed today (see Objective section for details).
    *   Medications: Continue Xeljanz XR 11mg daily and Celebrex 200mg daily.
    *   Imaging: Order X-ray of the right knee to assess for underlying cause of swelling.
    *   Referral: Refer to Physical Therapy for the right knee.
    *   Future Planning: Discussed potential surgical consult if conservative measures are ineffective.
2.  **Lower Extremity Pitting Edema, Right Leg:**
    *   Imaging: X-ray of the right knee (as above) to help assess cause.
    *   Patient Education: Advised to continue using compression socks, elevate feet frequently (especially at night), and reduce dietary salt intake.
    *   Follow-up: Advised to follow up with his Primary Care Physician if edema does not improve with these measures.
3.  **High-Risk Medication Use (Xeljanz):**
    *   Monitoring: Continue monitoring CMP levels every couple of months.
    *   Follow-up: Schedule blood work prior to the next follow-up appointment.
*   **General:** Post-procedure instructions given. Patient will follow up with PCP as discussed regarding edema."
virtscribe,D2N145,"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

• Perioral dermatitis
• Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist’s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.","S:
**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Follow-up for facial rash (perioral dermatitis).

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:** Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female presenting for follow-up of perioral dermatitis and rosacea. She reports her perioral dermatitis is much better but has not fully resolved, describing it as having ""plateaued"" over the past week. She had been using doxycycline twice daily for the first two weeks with significant improvement. Approximately one week ago, based on pharmacist advice, she reduced the doxycycline dose to once daily and has not seen continued improvement since then. She is currently using sulfacetamide wash twice daily, which she reports is not drying and feels good, providing moisture. She applies MetroCream immediately after washing. She denies using any other lotions, Cetaphil cleanser/lotion, or Neutrogena wipes. She did not start Elidel due to insurance cost and initial concerns about side effects based on information she read. She was counseled on the safety profile of topical Elidel/tacrolimus compared to oral forms. She reports sun sensitivity while on doxycycline and is taking precautions (wearing a hat).

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**
- Perioral dermatitis
- Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

**MEDICATIONS:**
- Doxycycline (oral, dose/frequency varied per HPI)
- MetroCream (topical, frequency per HPI)
- Sulfacetamide wash (topical, frequency per HPI)

**ALLERGIES:**
- None mentioned.

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:**
- General: No systemic symptoms discussed.
- HEENT: Ocular rosacea mentioned as diagnosis, but no specific ocular symptoms discussed in this encounter.
- Respiratory: No respiratory symptoms discussed.
- Cardiovascular: No cardiovascular symptoms discussed.
- Skin: As detailed in HPI (facial rash, improvement, plateau, dryness with previous wash but not current, sun sensitivity).

O:
**PHYSICAL EXAM:**
- **Integumentary:** Fitzpatrick skin type IV-V. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few faint erythematous papules. Mild redness is noted around and underneath the nostrils.
- Other systems not examined/discussed.

A:
**ASSESSMENT:**
1.  **Perioral dermatitis:** Improved but not fully resolved, currently plateaued. Likely related to reduction in doxycycline frequency from twice daily to once daily. Objective exam confirms residual faint papules and redness in characteristic areas.
2.  **Rosacea, including ocular rosacea:** Chronic condition, currently managed with MetroCream and eyelid hygiene recommendations.

P:
**PLAN:**
1.  **Perioral dermatitis:**
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Doxycycline: Increase back to twice daily (BID) until rash is completely gone, then continue once daily (QD) for an additional week before stopping. Patient has sufficient refills.
        *   Tacrolimus ointment: Prescribed to apply to rash on face twice daily until resolved. Counseled patient on potential transient tingling/redness sensation upon application, emphasizing it is not an allergy or harmful reaction. Discussed cost issues with Elidel and Eucrisa, finding Tacrolimus ointment potentially more affordable via coupon.
        *   Sulfacetamide wash: Continue use. Patient prefers twice daily, which is acceptable unless dryness occurs, then reduce to once daily.
        *   MetroCream: Continue use after washing. Patient has sufficient supply.
        *   Elidel cream: Prescription will be canceled to avoid confusion.
        *   Clindamycin: Will be removed from medication list.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Discussed adding a moisturizer. Recommended basic options like Vanicream or petroleum jelly if very dry. Samples will be provided.
    *   **Education:** Reinforced counseling on doxycycline side effects (GI upset, heartburn, photosensitivity) and need for sun protection. Explained the safety profile of topical calcineurin inhibitors (Tacrolimus) compared to oral forms and steroids, noting they do not cause skin thinning. Advised against using old products or trying new products without discussing first.
2.  **Rosacea, including ocular rosacea:**
    *   **Medications:** Continue MetroCream as above.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Recommend gentle eyelid wash once daily with a gentle cleanser (e.g., Vanicream). Use Bruder mask as needed.
3.  **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in approximately 4 weeks to assess response to treatment.
4.  **Return Precautions:** Patient instructed to call or send a MyChart message if symptoms worsen significantly before the follow-up appointment. If mild flair occurs after resolution, can try Tacrolimus ointment for a few days; if not sufficient, restart doxycycline."

[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating

[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain

Abdominal pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports enjoying nature photography.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.
Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No murmurs, clicks, or rubs.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Soft, nondistended abdomen. Positive slight guarding to the right upper quadrant, but without rebound tenderness. Positive for Murphy signs. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.
- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Abdominal pain for several weeks.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Bobby presents today, referred by Dr. Miller, for evaluation of abdominal pain he has experienced for several weeks. The pain is located on the right side of his belly, underneath his ribs. He describes the pain as severe and squeezing, rating it an 8/10 when severe. The pain is intermittent, coming and going, but is typically related to eating, occurring either immediately after or a couple of hours later. When the pain is severe, he experiences nausea and feels sick to his stomach. He reports occasional low-grade fevers associated with the pain over the past couple of days. He denies vomiting. An outside ultrasound performed by Dr. Miller reportedly showed gallstones. He was advised to avoid high-fat foods, which he states has provided some improvement, but the pain persists. He notes difficulty completely eliminating fatty foods, particularly pork rinds, as he follows a keto diet for Type 2 Diabetes management. He reports this diet has helped improve his diabetes symptoms and blood sugars, and he has lost approximately 25 pounds over the last three months. The pain has not significantly affected his ability to exercise, although he avoids strenuous activity right after eating.

**Past Medical History:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (managed with diet and exercise).

**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.

**Family History:** Significant for gallbladder disease in both parents, both of whom had their gallbladders removed.

**Social History:** Enjoys nature photography. Reports not being a big exerciser right after eating.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Reports occasional low-grade fevers. Denies vomiting.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Reports right-sided, severe, squeezing abdominal pain related to eating. Reports nausea.
*   **Other systems:** Not discussed.

**Medications:** None mentioned.
**Allergies:** None mentioned.

**Vital Signs:**
*   Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg
*   Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
*   Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute
*   Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air
*   Temperature: Afebrile

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Cardiovascular:** Heart rate regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats, clicks, rubs, or murmurs noted on auscultation.
*   **Respiratory:** Lungs clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Abdomen soft and nondistended. Positive bowel sounds noted. Slight guarding present in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness appreciated. Positive for Murphy's sign. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.
*   **Other systems:** Not examined or discussed.

**Results:**
*   **Abdominal Ultrasound (outside facility):** Reviewed. Demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder with mild thickening. Common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

A:
1.  **Mild Cholecystitis with Gallstones:** Based on the patient's history of intermittent, postprandial right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back, associated nausea and low-grade fevers, physical exam findings of right upper quadrant guarding and a positive Murphy's sign, and ultrasound evidence of multiple gallstones and mild gallbladder thickening, the assessment is mild cholecystitis with gallstones. There is no evidence of frank obstruction based on the ultrasound findings (normal CBD size). Symptoms have been present for several weeks, suggesting chronic or recurrent inflammation. Despite dietary modifications (avoiding high-fat foods), symptoms persist.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Patient reports managing with diet (keto) and exercise, with reported improvement in blood sugars and significant weight loss.

P:
1.  **Mild Cholecystitis with Gallstones:**
    *   **Treatment:** Recommend surgical intervention with laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to persistent, severe symptoms despite dietary modifications.
    *   **Procedure Discussion:** Discussed the planned procedure, explaining it involves a few small incisions, insertion of a scope and instruments to remove the gallbladder. Estimated surgery time is 1 to 1.5 hours.
    *   **Post-operative Course:** Anticipate overnight hospital stay for monitoring. Post-operatively, patient should continue to avoid high-fat foods and focus on high-fiber foods.
    *   **Activity:** Advised to take it easy for the first 24 hours post-op. May resume walking on solid ground within a day or two, but avoid strenuous activity like hiking initially.
    *   **Follow-up:** Schedule surgery for next week. Follow up in clinic in about a week or so post-operatively for wound check and clearance to resume normal activities, including nature photography.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Management:** Continue current management plan as outlined by primary care physician or endocrinologist.
    *   **Coordination of Care:** Advised patient to follow up with his primary care physician regarding the impending surgery to ensure appropriate diabetes management peri-operatively.

Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the assessment and plan. Paperwork for surgery will be completed with the nurse."

[doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs
[patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy
[doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain
[patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help
[doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol
[patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time
[doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen
[patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it
[doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all
[patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that
[doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom
[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues
[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any
[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee
[doctor] okay
[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since
[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee
[patient] it was a total knee replacement
[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said
[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty

[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good
[patient] good
[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] any questions
[patient] not at this point
[doctor] okay great thank you
[patient] thank you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Adams is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. The onset of his pain began 4 months ago, when he was moving boxes out of his son’s college dorm. At that time, he noted tingling in his right toes, which resolved after approximately 1 hour. After his injury, he felt as though he was unable to support his upper body weight. The patient reports weakness in his legs when carrying heavy objects. He reports a sharp pain in his lower back when he turns a certain way or rolls over in his sleep. The pain will resolve with repositioning. The patient was seen at urgent care and was referred to obtain an MRI, however he did not undergo this secondary to insurance issues. He has been utilizing Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice for pain, which does not provide relief. The patient notes the ibuprofen is slightly more beneficial than the Tylenol, however it does not relieve his symptoms. He denies upset stomach with the use of ibuprofen. Additionally, he attempted physical therapy at his gym without any relief. He denies any bladder or bowels issues, fevers, and chills.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient has a history of a right total knee arthroplasty 2 years ago, in spring of 2020. He states that his right knee feels 95% improved since the surgery.

MSK: Examination of the Lumbar spine: No pain to palpation of the lumbar spine. Decreased flexion and extension of the lower back. Positive straight leg raise. Spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine. Strength is equal bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the lumbar spine were reviewed. These reveal no acute bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Low back pain, possible acute disc herniation.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. His x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I would like to obtain an MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate for a possible acute disc herniation. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. He will continue with physical therapy and a referral was provided for this today.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Low back pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Jeremy Adams is a 57-year-old male presenting with low back pain that began approximately four months ago. The onset occurred while moving boxes. Initially, he experienced a sensation of being unable to support his upper body weight and transient tingling in the toes of his right foot, which resolved after about an hour and has not recurred. He reports sharp pain in his lower back when turning a certain way or rolling over in his sleep, which wakes him up but resolves with repositioning. He notes weakness in his legs only when carrying heavy objects. He attempted physical therapy at his gym without relief. He has tried Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice for pain, reporting no significant relief. He states ibuprofen is slightly more beneficial than Tylenol but provides relief for a shorter duration. He denies stomach upset from ibuprofen use. He was seen at an urgent care previously and was recommended an MRI, but did not pursue it at that time due to insurance concerns; he now wishes to proceed with imaging. He denies any current numbness or tingling in his feet, difficulty or weakness in his legs except when carrying heavy objects, bladder or bowel issues, fevers, or chills.

**Past Medical History:** Right total knee replacement approximately two years ago (Spring 2020), reports 95% improvement since surgery.

**Past Surgical History:** Right total knee replacement (Spring 2020).

**Family History:** Not discussed.

**Social History:** Not discussed.

**Imaging:**
*   **Lumbar Spine X-ray:** Reviewed in office. Showed no acute bony abnormality (no fracture).

A:
**Problem List:**
1.  Low back pain, likely acute disk herniation.

**Assessment:** The patient is a 57-year-old male presenting with chronic low back pain ongoing for four months following an injury. Symptoms include sharp pain with movement/position changes, transient initial right toe tingling, and weakness with heavy lifting. Physical exam reveals decreased lumbar range of motion, positive straight leg raise, and paraspinal muscle spasm, though no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine. Lumbar spine x-rays ruled out acute bony abnormalities such as fracture. Based on the history and physical findings, the most likely diagnosis is an acute disk herniation, despite the duration of symptoms. Other potential causes of back pain are considered but less likely given the specific findings.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Low back pain / Possible acute disk herniation:**
    *   Order lumbar spine MRI for better visualization of soft tissue structures to evaluate for disk herniation.
    *   Continue physical therapy; provided referral to a physical therapist within the health system.
    *   Prescribe Meloxicam 15 mg by mouth daily for pain and inflammation.
    *   Discussed rationale for MRI (soft tissue evaluation).
    *   Discussed potential future treatment options such as epidural steroid injection if disk herniation is confirmed on MRI.
    *   Patient verbalized understanding and had no further questions at this time.
2.  **Follow-up:** Follow-up plan not explicitly detailed in transcript, but implied after MRI results are available to discuss findings and further management."

aci,D2N150,"[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen
[patient] about three days ago
[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan
[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Scott Miller is a pleasant 36-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The injury occurred 3 days ago, when he was playing pickup soccer games and felt a pop in his right knee. He reports swelling at the time of the injury, which has improved. The patient states that his knee is not as functional or moving as well as it used to be. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 7 out of 10 currently and a 4 to 5 out of 10 when the swelling decreases. The patient has been taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, which provides some relief. He states that he is able to bend his knee with pain towards the end of this motion; however, when he goes to straighten his knee, he feels like he has to help it straight. The patient adds that he is able to bear weight on his right knee, however it feels loose and does not feel normal.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works at a desk.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: Marked limp in the right leg upon ambulation.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Significant effusion. Slight ecchymosis. Pain with palpation at the medial joint line. Difficulty with passive ROM. Lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to 115 degrees. Lacking 20-30 degrees of terminal flexion secondary to pain. Positive Lachman's test. Muscle strength is 5/5. Neurovascular intact distally.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible anterior cruciate ligament tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of the ACL. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg a day to reduce swelling and pain. We discussed that the patient should utilize ice and activity modification to reduce swelling and pain. I recommended that he wears a knee immobilizer and use crutches when he is ambulating. He will avoid jogging until we have the results of his MRI.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.","S:

[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up
[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain
[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping
[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else

[patient] did n't getting better
[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse
[patient] well it's just not getting better

[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly

[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts

[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Teresa Sullivan is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain. Her pain began 4 days ago, without any improvement. She denies any specific injury; however, she has recently increased her usage of a pottery wheel in creating a bowl for her son. She is currently unable to work with the pottery wheel secondary to pain. Her pain is in the medial aspect of her elbow. She notes it radiates medially down her arm as well. The patient rates her pain level as 7 out of 10 at its worst. She reports the pain wakes her at night if she rolls over. She denies ibuprofen or ice provide pain relief. The patient denies any previous elbow injuries.

The patient has a history of hypertension. She states she has been checking her blood pressures regularly. She adds that her blood pressures have been in the 110s to 130s range. She affirms she is taking lisinopril 10 mg daily and denies missing doses.

Regarding her diabetes type 2, she reports she sometimes forgets to take metformin 500 mg twice daily. At times, her blood sugar levels range from 150 to 170 mg/dL. She states that she has a sweet tooth and indulges in home baked goods. For exercise, she walks in the evening and in the morning. She walks 1 to 2 miles per day around her neighborhood.

The patient enjoys working with ceramics as well as baking cakes and cinnamon rolls for family gatherings.

Patient reports history of hypertension and diabetes type 2.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 10 mg and metformin 500 mg twice daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 120/70 mmHg.
Pulse Rate: Appropriate.
Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 100% on room air.
Body Temperature: 97.9 degrees F.
Pain Level: 7/10 at its worst.

SKIN: No rash or lesions.
MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. Pain with resisted pronation of the right forearm. Pain with flexion and bending the right wrist. No bruising or swelling. No discoloration or lesions.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right elbow was reviewed today. It demonstrated no evidence of any fractures. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right elbow pain, consistent with medial epicondylitis.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her elbow pain is consistent with medial epicondylitis and was most likely caused by overuse and damage to the tendons in her arm. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient will wear a sling on her right arm while she is awake to provide increased support. I advised her to ice her right elbow for 20 minutes 3 times per day. She will take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for 1 week. I have also advised her to hold off on creating pottery for the next 2 weeks to allow her arm to heal. If the patient continues to experience persistent elbow pain, we may consider formal physical therapy at her next visit.

I have encouraged the patient to check and record her blood sugars every day. I will increase her metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. The patient and I discussed the importance of her taking her medication on a regular basis twice a day. I have also recommended that she be referred to diabetic counseling for more information on the steps she can take to manage her diabetes. I will also order a hemoglobin A1c test for a more accurate assessment of her long-term blood sugar levels.

The patient’s hypertension is currently controlled with medication and exercise. I have instructed her to continue taking lisinopril 10 mg. I also encouraged her to continue with her walking routine.

All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the hemoglobin A1c test and discuss her progress.","S:

She has attempted ibuprofen and ice for relief, but states ibuprofen is not helping and she only tried ice a little bit at first. The pain is not getting better.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension
Diabetes Mellitus Type 2

MEDICATIONS:
Lisinopril 10 mg daily
Metformin 500 mg twice daily (notes sometimes forgets doses)

ALLERGIES:
No allergies mentioned.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Engages in pottery and baking as hobbies. Walks 1-2 miles per day around the neighborhood in the evening and sometimes in the morning. Notes a ""sweet tooth"" and indulges in home-baked goods.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Reports pain wakes her at night.
Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain radiating down the arm.
(Other systems reviewed by physical exam findings below)

O:
VITALS:
BP: 120/70 mmHg
Pulse Rate: Appropriate
Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
Temperature: 97.9 F
Oxygen Saturation: 100% on room air
Pain: 7/10 at its worst
Weight: 5 lb increase since last visit

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Cardiovascular: No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Pulses equal bilaterally.
Respiratory: Lungs clear bilaterally to auscultation.
Skin: At the right elbow, no rash, bruising, swelling, discoloration, or lesions noted.
Musculoskeletal: Right elbow examination reveals moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. Pain is elicited with resisted pronation of the right forearm and with flexion and bending of the right wrist. Denies pain with turning wrist outwards (supination).

RESULTS:
Right elbow X-ray reviewed: No evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

A:
1. Right elbow pain, consistent with medial epicondylitis: Based on subjective report of medial elbow pain radiating down the arm, associated with increased activity (pottery), severity 7/10, and objective findings of medial epicondyle tenderness, pain with resisted pronation and wrist flexion/bending. X-ray findings rule out fracture or bony abnormality, supporting a soft tissue/tendon etiology (overuse/tendon damage).
2. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, poorly controlled: Based on subjective report of sometimes forgetting Metformin doses, elevated blood sugar readings (150-170 mg/dL), and dietary habits (sweet tooth, baking).
3. Hypertension, controlled: Based on subjective report of checking blood pressures regularly (110s-130s) and taking Lisinopril 10mg daily, and objective finding of BP 120/70 today.

P:
1. Right elbow pain (Medial Epicondylitis):
    *   Rest: Avoid aggravating activities, specifically pottery, for the next 2 weeks.
    *   Support: Order right arm sling to wear while awake.
    *   Ice: Apply ice to the right elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times per day.
    *   Medication: Take Ibuprofen 600 mg by mouth every 6 hours with food for 1 week.
    *   Physical Therapy: Discuss potential referral to physical rehabilitation if pain persists at next visit.
2. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
    *   Medication: Increase Metformin to 1000 mg twice daily. Emphasize importance of regular dosing.
    *   Monitoring: Check and record blood sugars daily.
    *   Labs: Order Hemoglobin A1c test.
    *   Counseling: Recommend referral to diabetic counseling for dietary and management guidance.
    *   Follow-up: Return to clinic in 2 weeks to review A1c results and discuss diabetes management progress.
3. Hypertension:
    *   Medication: Continue Lisinopril 10 mg daily.
    *   Exercise: Continue daily walking routine.
    *   Follow-up: Will be assessed at the 2-week follow-up visit.

Follow-up: Patient instructed to follow up in clinic in 2 weeks to review Hemoglobin A1c results and discuss progress with diabetes management and elbow pain. Return precautions discussed (not explicitly mentioned in transcript, but standard practice and implied by follow-up)."

[doctor] well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears
[patient] i see
[doctor] okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no
[patient] no

[patient] hmmm no
[doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me
[patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery
[doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that
[patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know
[doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes
[patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know
[doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door

**Chief Complaint:** Back pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient is a [Age/Sex if mentioned - *not mentioned in transcript*] presenting with low back pain for approximately one week. The pain began after twisting to the left and potentially picking something up. The initial pain subsided but returned a few hours later and has been constant since. The pain is primarily located in the middle of the lower back, sometimes radiating towards the left side. It is aggravated by sudden movements, particularly twisting to the left. He has attempted over-the-counter medications without significant relief.

**Past Medical History:** History of Diabetes Mellitus.

**Social History:** Patient's family owns a bakery. Patient visits the bakery and occasionally consumes items from there.

**Medications:** Metformin twice daily. (Dose/Route/Frequency beyond ""twice daily"" not specified in transcript).

**Allergies:** None mentioned.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** No other symptoms mentioned.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** See HPI.
*   **Neurological:** Denies pain, numbness, or tingling in feet.
*   **Other systems (HEENT, Respiratory, Cardiovascular):** Not reviewed for symptoms during the encounter.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Not recorded in transcript.

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Eyes:** Exam performed, no specific findings described.
*   **Ears:** Exam performed, no specific findings described.
*   **Respiratory:** Lungs clear to auscultation.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Heart with regular rate and rhythm.
*   **Musculoskeletal:**
    *   Upper back: No pain to palpation.

    *   **Patient Education:** Advised caution with strenuous or hazardous activities (e.g., driving) after taking Flexeril due to potential sedation. Discussed rationale for PT (pain relief, strengthening).
2.  **Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Diagnostics:** Order Hemoglobin A1c to assess glycemic control over the past few months.
    *   **Medications:** Continue current dose of Metformin. Will re-evaluate medication regimen after A1c results are available.
    *   **Lifestyle:** Continue diet and exercise. Advised to watch intake of carbohydrates and sweets from the family bakery; occasional treats are acceptable, but routine consumption should be limited.
    *   **Monitoring:** Check blood sugar every morning upon waking. Keep a record of readings (writing them down is helpful).
    *   **Follow-up:** Will use A1c results and blood sugar logs to guide future management decisions. No specific follow-up appointment scheduled in transcript."
aci,D2N153,"[patient] i hope i did n't hurt it again
[doctor] hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee

[doctor] how long ago did that happen
[patient] about two and a half weeks ago
[doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you
[patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee
[doctor] the outside of your right knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
[patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle
[doctor] okay
[patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
[doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
[patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
[doctor] okay
[patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] really nothing
[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[patient] no i ride the bike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
[doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
[patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
[doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like
[patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
[doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
[doctor] okay when did you break your toe
[patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
[doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
[patient] right correct
[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[patient] no not physically
[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[patient] only when you pull it to the outside
[doctor] okay
[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[doctor] okay and so does that help at all
[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[patient] i will
[doctor] okay bye
[patient] bye","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Price is a pleasant 68-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2.5 weeks ago, when he stepped off of a curb and turned over his ankle. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right knee. The patient also reports clicking with ambulation. He denies any pain with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period of time. The patient also reports locking of his knee with prolonged standing. He notices pain when he is resting his foot on his heel. He denies any pain at rest and elevated, or when his foot is flat on the ground. The patient states that he is more active during the day, which does not impact his knee pain. He adds that he is able to perform a full squat without pain. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his right foot, however this is not new. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which provides him with relief at night. He has also been icing his knee 4 times per day, which provides him with relief in the morning and at the end of the day.

MEDICAL HISTORY

He states that he has fractured his 2nd toe 3 times over the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in sales. He rides a bike for exercise.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Neurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in his toes on his right foot from prior injury.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: >Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Slight edema. Slight effusion. No pain with palpation of the right lateral knee. Positive varus test. Full ROM. Negative Lachman's.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormality. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee lateral collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right knee injury.

**History of Present Illness:** Gregory Price is a 68-year-old male presenting for evaluation of right knee pain and clicking. Symptoms began approximately 2.5 weeks ago after stepping off a curb and turning his right ankle. He initially thought the ankle would be the primary issue, but after ankle soreness resolved, the pain localized to the outside (lateral aspect) of his right knee. He reports clicking in the knee when walking. Pain is generally absent with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period, at which point he feels the knee is ""locked"" and he has to ease into walking again. He denies pain when the knee is resting elevated or with the foot flat on the floor, but notes pain when resting his foot on his heel. He denies pain at rest otherwise. He reports the most clicking occurs during a full squat, but denies pain with squatting. He is active, riding a bike (Peloton), but is not currently doing so due to the injury. He denies new numbness or tingling in his foot, noting pre-existing numbness related to prior toe fractures. He has taken ibuprofen at night, which helps him settle down and sleep better, but finds it less impactful during the day when he is more active. He has been icing the knee 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off, at least four times a day, which he feels helps in the morning and before bed, though he notes it doesn't change symptoms by much due to his pain threshold. He feels his symptoms have remained about the same for the last two weeks, only worsening temporarily with exertion like gardening or moving pots.

**Medical History:** Reports fracturing his right 2nd toe three times over the last 10 years, resulting in some residual numbness depending on footwear.

**Social History:** Works in sales from home. Exercises by riding a bike (Peloton).

**Review of Systems:**
General: Symptoms unchanged over the last two weeks, except for temporary worsening with exertion.
Musculoskeletal: Positive for right knee pain (lateral), clicking, and locking sensation with prolonged single-leg standing. Denies pain with normal ambulation or squatting.
Neurological: Positive for pre-existing numbness/tingling in the right foot related to prior toe fractures; denies new numbness/tingling.

**Medications:**
Ibuprofen (dose/frequency not specified in transcript) - taken at night for pain.

**Allergies:**
Not mentioned in transcript.

O:
**Physical Exam:**
Cardiovascular: Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
Musculoskeletal: Right Knee: Slight edema appreciated. Slight effusion noted. No pain to palpation of the right lateral knee. Positive varus test. Full range of motion. Negative Lachman sign.

**Imaging:**
Right knee X-ray (4 views): Reviewed. No evidence of acute fracture, dislocation, or bony abnormality.

A:
**Assessment:**
1. Right knee lateral collateral ligament (LCL) strain: Based on mechanism of injury (inversion/turning ankle), location of pain (lateral knee), positive varus stress test on exam, and negative findings for fracture/bony abnormality on X-ray. The clicking and locking sensation are also consistent with ligamentous or meniscal injury, though the primary assessment is LCL strain.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Right Knee LCL Strain:**
    *   **Medication:** Prescribed Meloxicam 15 mg by mouth daily for pain and inflammation.
    *   **Physical Therapy:** Referral initiated for formal physical therapy to strengthen surrounding muscles and support the knee, aiming to improve stability and prevent future injury.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Continue icing the affected knee as previously doing (20 min on/20 min off, 4x/day).
    *   **Patient Education:** Discussed X-ray results, confirming no fracture or bony abnormality. Explained that LCL strains typically heal on their own and do not require surgical intervention in this case.
    *   **Follow-up:** If pain does not improve with physical therapy, will consider obtaining an MRI for further evaluation. Patient instructed to call if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise."

[doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training
[patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but
[doctor] okay
[patient] i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off
[doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both
[patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that
[doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i
[doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also
[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[doctor] okay
[patient] or
[doctor] no go ahead go ahead
[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[patient] no it's mainly just on the right
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too
[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[patient] that's real tender
[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[patient] no i i was watching the track meet
[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here
[patient] used to when i lived in detroit
[doctor] oh
[patient] hockey town but not so much anymore
[doctor] no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later
[patient] thanks","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dennis Martin is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right heel pain. The onset of his pain began 10 days ago while training for a triathlon. He locates his pain to the posterior aspect of his heel, which radiates proximally into his calf. His pain is aggravated by working out and when he first gets up in the morning. If he sits for a long period, his pain will return upon standing. The patient states that he runs 10 kilometers in the morning. At lunchtime, he tries to get on a bike for about 45 minutes to an hour. In the evening, he goes to the aquatic center and swims for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The patient states that he runs 5 days per week. He adds that he alternates between a long run and a long bike ride on weekends. He currently takes one day off from his exercises. The patient states that he does not stretch at all. He denies any left leg pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right heel pain. Denies left leg pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right heel: Pain with resisted extension. Mild pain with flexion. Positive calcaneal squeeze test. Severe tenderness to the Achilles tendon. Thompson test is negative, bilaterally.

RESULTS

No new imaging was obtained today

ASSESSMENT

Right Achilles tendinitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely secondary to overuse. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient was instructed to take at least 1 week off from his training to recover from this. I will provide him with a referral for formal physical therapy to strengthen his right lower extremities. I have advised him to take 3 tablets of ibuprofen every 6 hours for pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an x-ray.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 to 10 days to check on his progress.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right heel pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Dennis Martin is a 46-year-old male presenting with right posterior heel pain radiating into the calf. The pain began approximately 10 days ago, coinciding with aggressive training for a triathlon. The pain is typically worse after workouts and upon first waking in the morning, describing it as feeling ""really tight and almost like it's tearing."" It eases slightly after walking for 10-15 minutes but becomes ""really sore again"" after sitting for an extended period and then standing, or after significant activity. He trains 5 days a week, running ~10 km in the morning, biking 45-60 minutes at lunchtime, and swimming 30-60 minutes in the evening. On weekends, he alternates between a long run and a long bike ride, taking one day off per week. He reports he does not stretch at all. He denies any pain in the left leg.

**Past Medical History:** Not discussed.
**Past Surgical History:** Not discussed.
**Family History:** Not discussed.
**Social History:** Reports training aggressively for a triathlon. Reports previously living in Detroit. Denies stretching.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports right heel pain radiating to calf. Denies left leg pain.
*   **Other systems:** Not discussed.

**Medications:** Not currently taking any medications for this issue (implied by doctor's question and recommendation).
**Allergies:** Not discussed.

O:
**Vitals:** Not discussed.
**Physical Exam:**
*   **Lower Extremities:**
    *   Right lower extremity: Mild pain with resisted dorsiflexion. Mild pain with resisted plantarflexion. Positive calcaneal squeeze test with significant pain. Severe tenderness upon palpation of the Achilles tendon.
    *   Left lower extremity: Not painful with calcaneal squeeze test.
    *   Thompson test: Negative bilaterally.

**Imaging/Labs:** No imaging or labs discussed.

A:
**Problems:**
1.  Right Achilles tendinitis.

**Assessment:** Based on the patient's reported symptoms of posterior heel pain radiating to the calf, exacerbated by activity and initial movement after rest, combined with objective findings of tenderness to palpation of the Achilles tendon and a positive calcaneal squeeze test, the diagnosis of right Achilles tendinitis is made. This is likely secondary to overuse given the patient's recent initiation of aggressive triathlon training and reported lack of stretching. Achilles tendon rupture was considered and ruled out by a negative Thompson test.

P:
**Right Achilles Tendinitis:**
*   **Activity Modification:** Recommend stopping training for 1-2 weeks to allow for healing.
*   **Medication:** Start Ibuprofen (Advil), 3 tablets every 6 hours, for anti-inflammatory effect.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Order a referral for physical therapy visits to focus on strengthening and stretching exercises for the lower extremities, and to educate the patient on proper stretching techniques before activity.
*   **Imaging:** No X-ray indicated at this time. Will consider if significant pain persists after 10 days despite activity modification and physical therapy.
*   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 7-10 days following the first physical therapy appointment to monitor progress. Patient instructed to call the office to schedule the follow-up once the PT appointment is scheduled."

Non-healing right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christina Cooper is a pleasant 77-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. The onset of her wound began 1 year ago with no specific injury. The patient states that it seemed like a blister and she picked at it where it then turned red. The patient was seen by her primary care physician and was prescribed Keflex. She states that the antibiotics improved her symptoms, however they did not resolve them. The patient adds that she was last on Keflex 5 months ago. She denies any pain, however she reports decreased sensation in her foot. The patient also reports increased drainage and fatigue. She states that she has been wearing her regular shoes.

The patient has type 2 diabetes with neuropathy. She states that her blood sugars are running better than they were; however, they are still in the 200's. Her last hemoglobin A1C was 10.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fatigue.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer and drainage.

VITALS

No fever noted. Vitals look good today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right foot: There is a 1.0 cm x 2.0 cm wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. I do see some yellow slough that is present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. There is no evidence of fluid collection. I do not see necrosis. No odor. I do not appreciate any bony exposure. No pain to palpation.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right foot today reveals no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

Right diabetic foot ulcer.

PLAN

I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine her blood supply to see if we can heal the wound. We discussed doing a debridement in office today, which she agreed to. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support. I have also prescribed the patient collagenase ointment to apply to her wound 1 time per day and cover it with a sterile dressing. I advised the patient that this should be continued until we see the ulcer decrease in size.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Non-healing right foot ulcer.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Christina Cooper is a 77-year-old female presenting for evaluation of a non-healing ulcer on her right foot. The ulcer has been present for approximately one year. She reports no specific trauma initiating the wound; it began as a blister which she picked at, leading to redness and infection. She was treated with Keflex by her primary care physician about five months ago, which she states improved symptoms but did not result in complete healing. She denies pain in the foot but reports decreased sensation (neuropathy). Lately, she has noted increased drainage from the ulcer and reports feeling more tired. She states she has been wearing her regular shoes. She mentions plans to walk at the zoo this weekend.

**Past Medical History:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Neuropathy. Patient reports her blood sugars are currently running in the 200s and her last A1C was 10.

**Social History:** Patient reports plans for walking and eating out this weekend.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Reports fatigue. Denies fever, chills.
*   **Skin:** Reports right foot ulcer and increased drainage.
*   **Neurological:** Reports decreased sensation in the foot.

**Medications:** Patient reports past use of Keflex approximately 5 months ago for the ulcer. No current medications or allergies mentioned in the transcript.

O:
**Vitals:** No fever noted. Vitals noted as ""good"". (Specific values not provided in transcript).

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Right Foot Exam:** A 1.0 cm x 2.0 cm circular wound is present on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, located just proximal to the 5th metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The wound base contains yellow slough with minimal granulation tissue. There is no surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No evidence of fluid collection or necrosis is observed. No odor is present. Bony exposure is not appreciated. No pain reported with palpation of the wound.

**Results:**
*   **X-ray Right Foot (Today):** No evidence of osteomyelitis.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Right Diabetic Foot Ulcer:** Chronic, non-healing ulcer on the lateral dorsal right foot, likely exacerbated by underlying Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and peripheral neuropathy, leading to decreased sensation and impaired healing. The ulcer has been present for one year and has a history of infection. Objective findings include the ulcer size, presence of slough, minimal granulation tissue, and absence of surrounding cellulitis, fluid collection, necrosis, odor, or bony exposure. X-ray today rules out underlying osteomyelitis. Contributing factors include lack of offloading (wearing regular shoes) and poorly controlled diabetes (A1C 10, sugars in 200s).
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Poorly Controlled:** Patient reports blood sugars in the 200s and a recent A1C of 10, indicating suboptimal glycemic control, which significantly impacts wound healing. This is being managed by her primary care physician.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Right Diabetic Foot Ulcer:**
    *   **Diagnostics:** Order Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) to assess peripheral blood flow and healing potential.
    *   **Procedure:** Perform in-office debridement of the ulcer today to remove non-viable tissue.
    *   **Medication:** Prescribe collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily.
    *   **Wound Care:** Cover the ulcer with a sterile dressing after ointment application. Continue daily application and dressing changes until the ulcer begins to shrink.
    *   **Offloading:** Obtain a surgical shoe for the patient to wear consistently to reduce pressure on the ulcer site, especially given planned activity. Educated patient on the importance of offloading for healing.
    *   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in two weeks for re-evaluation of the ulcer and possible repeat debridement.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Acknowledge patient's report of high blood sugars and A1C. Advised patient to follow up with her primary care physician regarding optimizing glycemic control, as this is crucial for wound healing."
aci,D2N156,"[doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing

[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral leg swelling.

VITALS

Within normal limits

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: No carotid bruits. A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left base.
- Examination: Right radial artery cath site is clean, dry, and intact without hematoma. Radial artery pulses are palpable.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Bilateral lower limb edema. Pitting 1+.

RESULTS

EKG is reviewed and demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm. Good R wave progression. Evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a STEMI.

Echocardiogram is reviewed and demonstrates a reduced ejection fraction of 35%.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease that we will continue to monitor.
- Medical Treatment: She will continue aspirin 81 mg daily and Brilinta 90 mg twice daily. She will continue Lipitor 80 mg a day and Toprol 50 mg daily. I am going to refer her to cardiac rehab for education and to gain confidence to resume exercising regularly.

2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Medical Reasoning: A recent echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. She was able to be treated in the cath lab in a timely manner, so I think that the muscle is just stunned. Given her history. it will improve over time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient that she will recover since she is compliant with her medications.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.

3. Acute heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid.
- Medical Treatment: I am going to prescribe Lasix 40 mg once a day. I want to add Aldactone 12.5 mg daily. I will order lab work. We will obtain a repeat echo in approximately 2 months.

4. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Blood pressure is well controlled. She will tolerate the Aldactone well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue exercising and to be cognizant of her diet. I explained that there are healthier alternatives available to reduce the amount of preserved meats she consumes.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily. The patient received a referral to nutrition counseling to consider what other diet options might be available to her.

5. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin as prescribed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

She went to the emergency room and received another stent. She denies current chest pain or shortness of breath. She reports noticing bilateral leg swelling since being discharged from the hospital. She uses a couple of pillows to sleep and feels she may have had to sit up a little more recently, but for the most part, sleep position feels ""pretty normal."" She reports being able to afford her medications and is taking them as prescribed, understanding their importance. Regarding diet, she admits to being less strict with salt intake since her last heart attack, stating she loves pizza (especially pepperoni) and fries, but is willing to work on reducing salt. She is actively managing her diabetes by watching her sugars, taking Metformin, and walking her dog daily (1.5-2 miles).

aci,D2N157,"[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixty
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks
[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome anything else

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: 1+ non-pitting lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Lab results are reviewed and show stable a creatinine level.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing very well and has been compliant with all medications. A slight 3/6 ejection murmur was heard on exam, however, this is stable and has been present in the past. He is experiencing 1+ non-pitting edema, but this seems to be medication related.

- Patient Education and Counseling: Patient was advised that his stents will remain in place permanently and that they typically do not require replacement. We discussed it is common to experience dizziness when standing quickly and that this should resolve once he is adjusted to his medications. We also discussed that cardiac rehab will be beneficial in helping him become more active and confident with exercising. He was advised to watch for symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion as this would need further testing such as a stress test.
- Medical Treatment: Referral to cardiac rehab was provided. A refill for metoprolol 50 mg once a day and Crestor 40 mg once a day was also provided. He is also advised to continue aspirin daily long term as well as Brilinta for the next 6 months.

2. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: Patient's most recent creatinine levels are stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of following up with nephrology.
- Medical Treatment: He will follow up with his nephrologist, Dr. Miller.

3. Diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Patient reports most recent hemoglobin A1c was 16.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of diabetes management and how plays an important role in his coronary artery disease. He was advised that his hemoglobin A1c goal will be 6.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat hemoglobin A1c was ordered today. A dietitian referral for diabetes education was also provided. We will contact his primary care physician regarding his insulin regimen.

4. Mild depression:
- Medical Reasoning: Patient reports feeling depressed and having a hard time adjusting since having his heart attack. He mentions he is also lonely and does not have a support system.
- Medical Treatment: Referral to psychiatry was provided today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up for coronary artery disease and concerns regarding medications and dizziness.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Jose presents for follow-up approximately 3-4 months after his last visit and 6 months after experiencing a heart attack requiring stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. He reports feeling okay overall and believes his medications are helping, though he expresses concern about the number of medications he is taking. His primary new complaint is dizziness upon standing up quickly, which he wonders if is related to his heart attack or medications. He also reports experiencing headaches. He states he has been feeling ""kinda down"" and lonely since his heart attack, living alone with his dog, and describes his life as feeling difficult. He denies thoughts of harming himself or others. He reports his fasting blood glucose is around 130, but his most recent hemoglobin A1c was approximately 60, which he acknowledges is not where he wants it to be. He reports having had blood work done as requested and is following advice to avoid NSAIDs like Motrin and Advil for pain, having discarded them. He asks about alternative pain relief for headaches and was advised to take Tylenol. He is concerned about the permanence of his stent and if it will need replacement, and asks about warning symptoms. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion. He reports needing refills for his medications.

aci,D2N158,"[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well
[doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime
[patient] i will

**History of Present Illness:** Barbara is a 31-year-old female with a history of diabetes type 2 and asthma presenting with abdominal pain for the past one week. The pain is located in both sides of her upper abdomen and has been gradually increasing in severity. She reports intermittent nausea (approximately 3 times in the past week) and vomiting (a couple of times) associated with the pain. She notes the pain increases when she works out, such as jogging or running. She hypothesizes the pain may be related to increased coffee intake over the past week, stating her intake was ""pretty bad"" towards the end of last week, though she has controlled it this week. She also later reports eating a lot of spicy food lately which she feels may be contributing. She denies fever or diarrhea.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Diabetes Type 2
*   Asthma
*   Gastritis (patient report)

**Social History:**
*   Reports a history of moderately heavy alcohol use.
*   Reports increased coffee intake recently.
*   Reports eating a lot of spicy food lately.

**Medications:**
*   Metformin 500 mg twice daily (patient reports this is helping control blood sugars)
*   Flovent twice daily (patient reports sometimes forgetting)
*   Albuterol as needed for wheezing

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Denies fever.
*   **Respiratory:** Denies recent asthma attacks. Reports sometimes forgetting daily Flovent.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Reports abdominal pain (onset 1 week ago, increasing, bilateral upper abdomen, aggravated by exercise), intermittent nausea (3x in past week), vomiting (couple of times). Denies diarrhea. Reports recent increased coffee and spicy food intake.
*   **Endocrine:** Reports blood sugars are under control, ranging from 100s to 200s.

**Allergies:** Not mentioned.

O:
**Physical Exam:**
*   **General:** Unremarkable.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior exam. Otherwise normal heart exam.
*   **Respiratory:** Mild end expiratory wheezes, very faint. Otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Mild tenderness in the epigastrium. Abdomen is soft. No tenderness in the right lower quadrant. No significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant.

**Vitals:** Not mentioned.
**Labs/Imaging:** Not discussed.

A:
1.  **Acute Gastritis:** Likely etiology related to recent increased caffeine intake, history of moderately heavy alcohol use, and recent increased spicy food intake. Correlates with reported symptoms of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and physical exam finding of mild epigastric tenderness.
2.  **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:** Currently reported by patient to be under control with current medication regimen (Metformin 500mg BID). Blood sugars reported in 100-200 range.
3.  **Asthma:** Patient reports forgetting daily Flovent sometimes but denies recent attacks. Mild end expiratory wheezes noted on exam.

P:
1.  **Acute Gastritis:**
    *   **Lifestyle:** Advised patient to reduce caffeine intake, reduce alcohol intake (goal <2-3 drinks/week), and reduce spicy food intake.
    *   **Medication:** Prescribed Zantac twice daily.
    *   **Diagnostics:** Ordered Urinalysis, Urine Pregnancy Test, CBC, and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to rule out other causes.
2.  **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:**
    *   **Medication:** Adjust Metformin dose to 1000mg in the morning and continue 500mg in the evening.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue home blood sugar monitoring. Advised patient to bring readings to next visit.
3.  **Asthma:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Flovent daily. Continue Albuterol as needed for wheezing.
    *   **Education:** Reinforced importance of taking Flovent daily to decrease frequency of asthma attacks.

**Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 4 weeks. Advised patient to call if questions or concerns arise before then."
aci,D2N159,"[doctor] good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[patient] yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[doctor] okay how long has that been going on
[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[patient] some pain
[doctor] some pain
[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your mouth okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much
[doctor] thank you very much","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.

Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left. Positive Tinel's sign.

ASSESSMENT

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing her symptoms and exam findings, I believe her symptoms are secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome. We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right hand numbness, tingling, and pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Alexis presents with a 6-month history of intermittent numbness and tingling in her right hand, specifically affecting the thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Over the past month, these symptoms have become more persistent and are accompanied by pain. The pain is primarily experienced while typing on a keyboard and using a mouse. She reports that stopping typing/resting and taking ibuprofen provide some relief. She denies any associated sleep disturbance.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient reports working on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS: Ibuprofen (dose/frequency not specified by patient).

ALLERGIES: No allergies mentioned.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the right hand, particularly with typing and mouse use.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the right thumb, index finger, and middle finger.

O:
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Right Hand/Wrist:
- Pain elicited with wrist flexion.
- Pain elicited with wrist extension.
- Decreased grip strength noted on the right compared to the left.
- Positive Tinel's sign elicited with tapping on the inside of the wrist/forearm, causing shooting pain and grimacing.

A:
Right Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Based on the patient's reported symptoms of numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle fingers), pain aggravated by repetitive hand/wrist motion (typing, mouse), and objective findings on exam including pain with wrist flexion/extension, decreased grip strength, and a positive Tinel's sign, the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is strongly supported. This condition is common in individuals performing repetitive tasks such as data entry.

P:
1.  **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome:**
    *   Initiate conservative management.
    *   Recommend nighttime wrist splinting.
    *   Continue Ibuprofen, increasing dose to 600 mg four times daily for pain relief.
    *   Order outpatient EMG/Nerve Conduction Study of the right wrist to confirm diagnosis and assess severity.
    *   Discuss potential future treatment options based on EMG results, including physical therapy or surgical carpal tunnel release if conservative measures and splinting are insufficient and the study is positive.
2.  **Follow-up:** Return to clinic to discuss results of the EMG/Nerve Conduction Study and determine next steps in management."

Right elbow pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain.
Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow. Mild pain with flexion and extension but otherwise normal range of motion. There is swelling about the elbow, as well as mild ecchymosis.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Examination: Bruising noted over the right elbow.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right elbow was reviewed and demonstrates no evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right elbow contusion.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient sustained an injury to his elbow when his son struck him with a lacrosse stick. His x-ray and exam findings are consistent with an elbow contusion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to avoid playing lacrosse for the next couple of weeks, just until his elbow heals. After that, he should be fine to continue playing normally.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to prescribe him ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily to help with some of the pain and swelling. He should also ice the area in 20-minute intervals 3 times per day to further reduce his symptoms.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well-controlled with dietary modifications and lisinopril.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged him to keep up with his dietary modifications.
- Medical Treatment: We will keep him on lisinopril 20 mg daily.

3. Diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well controlled at this time.
- Medical Treatment: We will keep him on metformin 500 mg and order a hemoglobin A1c to evaluate any need for medication adjustments.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right elbow pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Philip is a gentleman presenting today with right elbow pain that started approximately one week ago while playing lacrosse with his 13-year-old son. The pain is located specifically at the point of the elbow (olecranon). He describes the pain as sharp, occurring anytime he moves the elbow. The pain radiates down the forearm. He denies falling but states his son was checking him with a stick, suggesting a possible direct blow. He attempted taking Advil a couple of days ago, which he feels helped somewhat, but he has not taken it consistently.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Hypertension
*   Diabetes

**Social History:** Denies smoking or alcohol use (not explicitly mentioned, but standard to include if discussed; based on transcript, this was not discussed, so omitting is appropriate per strict fidelity). Patient follows a low-salt, Mediterranean-style diet with his family. Plays lacrosse with his son.

**Family History:** Not discussed in transcript.

**Medications:**
*   Lisinopril 20 mg daily
*   Metformin 500 mg daily

**Allergies:** Not discussed in transcript.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** No fever or chills reported (not discussed).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain.
*   **Respiratory:** Denies shortness of breath or cough (not discussed).
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Denies abdominal pain.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports right elbow pain radiating down the forearm.
*   **Endocrine:** Reports blood sugars typically run 80-100 mg/dL when checked (not checked daily).

O:
**Vitals:**
*   Blood Pressure: 150/90 mmHg

**Physical Exam:**
*   **General:** Appears comfortable (not explicitly stated, but implied by lack of distress).
*   **Cardiovascular:** Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur noted on cardiac auscultation.
*   **Respiratory:** Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
*   **Musculoskeletal:**
    *   Right Elbow: Pain to palpation over the olecranon area of the posterior elbow. Mild pain with flexion and extension. Normal range of motion. Mild swelling and ecchymosis noted about the elbow.

**Imaging:**
*   Right Elbow X-ray: Reviewed prior to visit. Demonstrates no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. Findings are normal.

A:
1.  **Right Elbow Contusion:** Acute injury sustained while playing lacrosse, likely due to a direct blow from a stick. Subjective report of sharp, radiating pain with movement, localized to the olecranon, is supported by objective findings of pain to palpation, mild pain with movement, swelling, and ecchymosis over the posterior elbow. Normal range of motion and negative X-ray rule out fracture or significant bony injury.
2.  **Hypertension:** Chronic condition. Patient reports daily compliance with Lisinopril 20 mg and adherence to a low-salt, Mediterranean diet. Blood pressure is elevated today (150/90 mmHg), potentially related to white coat syndrome or other factors.
3.  **Diabetes Mellitus:** Chronic condition. Patient reports daily compliance with Metformin 500 mg. Reports self-monitored blood sugars typically run 80-100 mg/dL when checked (not checked daily). Appears well-controlled based on patient report.

P:
1.  **Right Elbow Contusion:**
    *   **Medication:** Prescribe Ibuprofen 800 mg, take twice daily for pain and swelling.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Recommend icing the right elbow three times daily for 20 minutes each session.
    *   **Activity Modification:** Advise avoiding playing lacrosse for the next couple of weeks to allow for healing.
    *   **Patient Education:** Explained that the injury is a bruise/contusion based on exam and X-ray findings, and that rest, ice, and ibuprofen should help symptoms.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Lisinopril 20 mg daily.
    *   **Diet:** Encourage continued adherence to low-salt diet.
    *   **Follow-up:** Will monitor blood pressure at future visits.
3.  **Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Metformin 500 mg daily.
    *   **Labs:** Order Hemoglobin A1c today to assess glycemic control over the past 3 months and evaluate potential need for future medication adjustment.
    *   **Follow-up:** Will review A1c results and discuss potential medication changes at a future visit.

**Follow-up:** Patient understands the plan. Return to clinic as scheduled for follow-up on chronic conditions. Return sooner if elbow symptoms worsen significantly or new concerns arise. Prescription for Ibuprofen provided."

[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright any other questions we got
[patient] that's it
[doctor] alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today
[patient] thank you appreciate it","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Chest pain on exertion.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a medical history of diabetes type 2. She has not been formally diagnosed with hypertension, but her blood pressures have been trending high.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of heart disease.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking metformin 500 mg twice daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies diaphoresis or clamminess.
Cardiovascular: Reports chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No JVD, swelling, or carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Assessment of Respiratory Effort:
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, otherwise normal rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Pulses are equal.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness. Soft, no guarding.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: 1+ nonpitting edema in the ankles. No calf tenderness.

RESULTS

EKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chest pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.
- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","S:

Bilateral knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Jackson is a pleasant 30-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral knee pain. She was referred by her primary care provider. The onset of her pain began 6 months ago. She denies any specific injury. The patient describes her pain as a deep, achy pain. She locates her pain to the posterior aspect of her patellae. The patient also reports “creaking” in her knees. She denies any swelling or redness in her knees. Her pain is aggravated by transitioning from a seated position to standing as well as ascending and descending stairs. Her pain is alleviated by rest. The patient has been icing her knees and wrapping her knees with an ACE bandage. She also takes ibuprofen or Aleve occasionally for pain. She states she tries to be as active as she can. She enjoys running outdoors. The patient adds that she would run 5 to 6 miles per day; however, she is unable to go 0.5 miles secondary to the pain. She denies any previous injuries to her knees.

She works from home.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of an upper extremity fracture when she was in 6th grade.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral knee pain and crepitus. Denies swelling or redness in the bilateral knees.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: Normal, no deformity present.
CV: Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.
No edema
NEURO: Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral lower extremities: Abduction strength is 3/5. Remainder of muscle strength is 5/5. Examination of the bilateral knees: No overlying erythema, ecchymosis, or warmth of the skin appreciated. No effusion. Tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinaculum. Positive patellar grind test. Knee pain with squatting. Negative Lachman test bilaterally. Negative anterior and posterior drawer tests bilaterally. Negative McMurray test bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the bilateral knees were reviewed today. These demonstrate no evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of formal physical therapy to increase her lower extremity strength, mobility, and correct any incorrect running mechanics. I encouraged her to take running easy for now. She can continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatories as needed for pain. All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me soon.","S:

Kyle Morales is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain.

Onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, when he was lifting a box of books and felt a pop. The pain is described as aching and sharp. His pain has been increasing since the time of onset and is beginning to radiate down his left leg. The patient denies any pain with sitting. He adds that he has a sedentary job. The patient states that his pain does not affect his job, however he feels that he does not want to be as active as he was previously. He tries to exercise a few times per week, however he is inconsistent. He denies any numbness, tingling, loss of sensation, weakness, and loss of control of his bladder or bowels.

The patient has been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol for pain, which provides some relief. He has not been evaluated for surgery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He denies smoking. The patient has a history of playing soccer in the midfield position.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient states that his father has back pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.
Neurological: Denies bowl or bladder control issues, numbness, tingling, decreased sensations, or weakness.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 130/70 mm Hg.
Respiratory rate: 18.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: I do not appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Clear to auscultation, bilaterally.
BACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity
NEURO: Normal sensation. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No ecchymosis noted. Midline tenderness at the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion. Positive supine straight leg test.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.

ASSESSMENT

Lumbar back pain at the L4-5 disc space due to a herniated disc with radiculopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his MRI revealed a herniated disc with radiculopathy. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of a corticosteroid injection. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a corticosteroid injection into the lumbar spine today. The patient was made aware of the risks of bleeding, infection, nerve damage, blood vessel damage, reaction to the medication, including skin changes, swelling, and also, the risk of elevated glucose levels if the patient were diabetic.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Low back pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents with a 2-week history of low back pain. The pain began suddenly while lifting a box of books, at which time he felt a ""pop"". The pain is described as ""real bad"", achy, and sharp in the low back. Initially localized, the pain is now starting to shoot down his left leg. He reports the pain has been getting worse since onset. Sitting is usually okay, but bending forward causes pain. He denies numbness, tingling, loss of sensation, weakness, and loss of bladder or bowel control. He has tried ibuprofen and Tylenol, which sometimes provide relief. He has not previously discussed surgery for this issue. He reports a sedentary job and inconsistent exercise habits (few times per week). The pain does not affect his job but makes him less active than previously.

**Past Medical History:** None mentioned.

*   **Neurological:** No decreased sensation noted. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.

**Imaging:**
*   **Lumbar Spine MRI:** Reviewed. Shows disc desiccation, a disc bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis. Interpreted by clinician as a herniated disk with nerve impingement.

A:
Lumbar back pain at the L4-L5 disk space due to a herniated disk with radiculopathy. This assessment is supported by the patient's history of acute onset with lifting, the character and radiation of pain, pain with lumbar flexion, a positive straight leg test on exam, and the MRI findings demonstrating disc herniation and neural foraminal stenosis at L4-L5.

P:
Discussed the diagnosis of a herniated disk with radiculopathy based on symptoms, exam findings, and MRI results.
Recommended a spinal injection consisting of a strong NSAID and a corticosteroid into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy to target the area of pain and inflammation.
Patient expressed interest in proceeding today. Will schedule the injection for today if possible.
Discussed potential risks associated with the injection, including bleeding, infection, nerve damage, blood vessel damage, and reaction to the medication (skin changes, swelling, elevated glucose if diabetic).
Patient will be provided with paperwork detailing the procedure and risks, and further questions will be addressed.
No specific follow-up appointment was scheduled or discussed in the transcript, beyond addressing questions today."
aci,D2N167,"[doctor] angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee

[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago
[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts
[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside
[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it
[patient] yeah i did
[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten
[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah
[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right
[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt
[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days
[patient] okay alright thanks
[doctor] alright any other questions
[patient] no that's it
[doctor] alright great thanks","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Angela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.

RESULTS

4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Left knee pain, possible MCL strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Left knee pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents with left knee pain that began approximately one week ago after falling while running with her niece. She reports twisting her knee in a ""funky way"" during the fall and heard a ""pop"" at the time of injury. Since the injury, she has been limping and the pain has not improved, prompting the visit. The pain is located on both sides of the knee, more so on the medial aspect than the lateral. She describes the pain as throbbing. Pain severity started at a 4/10 but is getting worse. She is unable to bear full weight on the left leg due to pain and limping. She has attempted to manage the pain with Tylenol, which provides only mild and temporary relief (effective for ~1-2 hours), and has wrapped the knee with kinesiology tape. She is unable to take NSAIDs like ibuprofen due to a history of an ulcer.

**Past Medical History:** History of ulcer precluding NSAID use.

**Medications:**
Tylenol (dose/frequency not specified by patient, taken PRN)

**Allergies:**
None mentioned.

O:
**Vitals:** Not documented in transcript.

**Physical Exam:**
Left Knee: Appreciates some edema and effusion. Moderate range of motion with pain on flexion and extension. Pain noted with palpation on the medial aspect. Negative Lachman's test. Negative valgus and varus stress tests.

**Imaging:**
Left Knee X-ray (4 views): Normal. No evidence of fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormalities.

A:
Left knee pain, likely Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) strain. Based on the mechanism of injury (twisting fall, pop), location of pain (medial > lateral), physical exam findings (edema, effusion, pain with flexion/extension, medial tenderness), and negative findings on exam (negative Lachman, valgus, varus tests ruling out significant ligamentous tear) and imaging (normal X-ray ruling out fracture/dislocation), an MCL strain is the most probable diagnosis.

P:
1.  **MCL Strain:**
    *   **Medication:** Prescribe Tramadol 50mg twice daily for pain. Continue Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain.
    *   **Immobilization:** Place patient in a knee immobilizer to be worn for the next week to limit movement and promote healing.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Recommend icing the left knee 3-4 times per day for 20-30 minutes each session to help reduce swelling.
    *   **Activity Restriction:** Advise patient to refrain from running for the next three weeks to allow the knee to heal.
    *   **Prognosis/Follow-up:** Discuss expected recovery time of approximately one month. Advise patient to call the office if symptoms worsen. If pain does not improve, consider further imaging such as an MRI."

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Martha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam. It has been a year since I last saw the patient.

The patient has been traveling a lot recently since things have gotten a bit better. She reports that she got her COVID-19 vaccine so she feels safer about traveling. She has been doing a lot of hiking.

She reports that she is staying active. She has continued watching her diet and she is doing well with that. The patient states that she is avoiding salty foods that she likes to eat. She has continued utilizing her medications. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in her legs.

Regarding her depression, she reports that she has been going to therapy every week for the past year. This has been really helpful for her. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

The patient reports that she is still forgetting to take her blood pressure medication. She has noticed that when work gets more stressful, her blood pressure goes up. She reports that work has been going okay, but it has been a lot of long hours lately.

She endorses some nasal congestion from some of the fall allergies. She denies any other symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from allergies.
• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression. Denies suicidal or homicidal ideations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities.

VITALS REVIEWED

• Blood Pressure: Elevated.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45%. Mitral regurgitation is present.

Lipid panel: Elevated cholesterol.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Martha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with her medication and dietary modifications. Her previous year's echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as some mitral regurgitation. Her cholesterol levels were slightly elevated on her lipid panel from last year.
• Additional Testing: We will order a repeat echocardiogram. We will also repeat a lipid panel this year.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue with her current medications. We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily and initiate Lasix 20 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with weekly therapy.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications but has been inconsistent with the use of her medication. She attributes elevations in her blood pressure to increased stress.
• Medical Treatment: We will increase her lisinopril to 40 mg daily as noted above.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to take her lisinopril as directed. I advised her to monitor her blood pressures at home for the next week and report them to me.

Healthcare maintenance.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is due for her routine mammogram.
• Additional Testing: We will order a mammogram and have this scheduled for her.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:

*   **Other Systems:** Not explicitly described in transcript.

**LABORATORY/IMAGING RESULTS (Discussed):**
*   **Echocardiogram (from last year):** Ejection Fraction 45% (low-ish pumping function). Mitral regurgitation present.
*   **Lipid Panel (from last year):** Cholesterol slightly elevated.

A:
**ASSESSMENT:**
1.  **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):** Chronic condition with reduced ejection fraction (45% on prior ECHO) and mitral regurgitation. Patient reports adherence to diet and current medications, but objective findings include 1+ pitting edema and elevated blood pressure, suggesting suboptimal control. Prior lipid panel showed slightly elevated cholesterol.
2.  **Hypertension:** Chronic condition, currently elevated in office and on review of past readings. Patient reports forgetting medication, particularly during periods of increased work stress. Elevated blood pressure contributes to difficulty controlling CHF symptoms (fluid retention).
3.  **Depression:** Chronic condition, well-controlled with weekly therapy. Patient denies current symptoms or suicidal/homicidal ideation.
4.  **Healthcare Maintenance:** Due for routine age-appropriate screening.

P:
**PLAN:**
1.  **Congestive Heart Failure:**
    *   **Medications:** Continue current CHF medications. Increase Lisinopril to 40 mg daily (for BP control and fluid management). Initiate Lasix 20 mg daily for fluid retention (edema).
    *   **Diet:** Continue low-sodium diet.
    *   **Monitoring:** Repeat echocardiogram this year. Repeat lipid panel this year.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    *   **Medications:** Emphasize importance of taking Lisinopril 40 mg daily as directed.
    *   **Monitoring:** Patient to monitor blood pressure daily at home for one week and report readings to assess control and need for additional agents.
    *   **Education:** Discuss potential link between work stress and blood pressure elevation. Advised patient can take all pills at the same time for adherence.
3.  **Depression:**
    *   **Therapy:** Continue weekly therapy.
    *   **Medications:** No change needed at this time given good control with therapy.
4.  **Healthcare Maintenance:**
    *   **Screening:** Order and schedule routine mammogram.

**FOLLOW-UP:**
Patient to monitor and report home blood pressures in one week. Follow-up as needed based on BP readings and test results. Return precautions discussed (not explicitly detailed in transcript, but implied by ""any questions?"")."

Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down the basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were very painful. The pain is equal in the bilateral knees. He states that he has had some knee problems in the past, but he believes that it was due to the repetition and the weight of the boxes. He states that the pain does not prevent him from doing his activities of daily living. By the end of the day on Saturday, his knee soreness interrupted his sleep. The patient has taken Tylenol and iced his knees for a short period of time, but nothing really seemed to help.

The patient states that he had a kidney transplant a few years ago for some polycystic kidneys. He notes that he saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago, and everything was normal at that time. The patient continues to utilize his immunosuppressant medications.

Regarding his hypothyroidism, the patient states that he is doing well. He has continued to utilize Synthroid regularly.

In regards to his arthritis, the patient states that occasionally he has pain in his elbow, but nothing out of the ordinary.

He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle pain. Endorses joint pain in the bilateral knees.
• Neurological: Denies headaches.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: There is edema and erythema of the right knee with pain to palpation. Range of motion is decreased. Left knee exam is normal.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No acute fractures.

Labs: Within normal limits. White blood cell count is within normal limits. Kidney function is normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. He presents today with complaints of joint pain.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports increased joint pain in his bilateral knees over the past weekend. Given that his right knee x-ray was unremarkable, I believe this is an acute exacerbation of his arthritis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an autoimmune panel for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to rest his knees. If his symptoms persist, we can consider further imaging and possibly a referral to physical therapy.

Hypothyroidism.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well on Synthroid and is asymptomatic at this time.
• Additional Testing: We will order a thyroid panel.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Synthroid.

Status post renal transplant.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well and has been compliant with his immunosuppressive medications. On recent labs, his white blood cell count was within a normal limits and his kidney function is stable.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Joint pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Andrew Perez is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for a kidney transplant, hypothyroidism, and arthritis, who presents today with complaints of joint pain.
The patient reports that over the weekend, he was moving boxes up and down basement stairs. By the end of the day, his knees were ""killing"" him. The pain is equally painful in both knees. He states he has had some knee problems in the past but believes the current pain is due to the repetition and weight of the boxes. He attempted Tylenol and iced his knees for a bit, but states ""nothing really seemed to help."" The pain was severe enough on Saturday night to keep him up for a bit. He denies fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Kidney transplant (a few years ago for polycystic kidneys). Reports doing well, saw Dr. Gutierrez a couple of weeks ago with no issues reported. Takes immunosuppressive medications regularly.
Hypothyroidism. Reports doing well on Synthroid, taking it regularly. Denies fatigue or weight gain.
Arthritis. Reports occasional elbow pain, but nothing out of the ordinary. Notes difficulty taking certain medications due to kidney transplant.

MEDICATIONS:
Synthroid (dose/frequency not specified)
Immunosuppressive medications (names/doses/frequencies not specified)

ALLERGIES:
Not mentioned in transcript.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Not mentioned in transcript.

FAMILY HISTORY:
Not mentioned in transcript.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, fatigue, weight gain.
HEENT: Denies headaches.
Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral knee pain, occasional elbow pain. Denies muscle aches.
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
(Other systems not discussed in transcript).

O:
VITAL SIGNS:
Reviewed in office: Look good. No fever. Heart rate and blood pressure look fine. (Specific values not provided in transcript).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur appreciated, noted as stable and heard in the past.
Musculoskeletal:
Right knee: Edema and erythema present. Pain to palpation. Decreased range of motion on exam.
Left knee: Looks fine/normal.

IMAGING:
Right knee x-ray reviewed: Shows good bony alignment. No acute fracture.

LABORATORY DATA:
Labs reviewed: White blood cell count is not elevated. Kidney function is very good. (Specific values not provided in transcript).

A:
1. Acute exacerbation of osteoarthritis/arthritis, bilateral knees: 62-year-old male presenting with acute onset of severe, activity-related bilateral knee pain, worse on the right with objective findings of edema, erythema, pain to palpation, and decreased range of motion. Subjective report of pain impacting sleep and lack of relief from OTCs. Objective data including normal right knee x-ray (ruling out acute fracture) and normal WBC count (less concerning for infection in immunocompromised patient) support an acute inflammatory process likely related to underlying arthritis exacerbated by physical activity.
2. Hypothyroidism: Patient reports doing well on current Synthroid regimen with no current symptoms of fatigue or weight gain.
3. Status post kidney transplant: Patient reports doing well and compliant with immunosuppressive medications. Recent labs show good kidney function and normal WBC count.
4. Generalized Arthritis: Chronic condition, patient reports occasional elbow pain. Management is complicated by kidney transplant limiting medication options.

P:
1. Acute knee pain (likely exacerbation of arthritis):
    - Medication: Prescribe Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.
    - Diagnostics: Order autoimmune panel.
    - Activity: Advised patient to take it easy/rest.
    - Follow-up: If symptoms continue, will consider further imaging and possible referral to physical therapy.
2. Hypothyroidism:
    - Medication: Continue Synthroid.
    - Diagnostics: Order thyroid panel.
3. Status post kidney transplant:
    - Continue current immunosuppressant regimen. Labs reviewed today show good kidney function and normal WBC.
4. Generalized Arthritis:
    - Management: Continue to manage symptomatically, acknowledging limitations with NSAIDs due to kidney transplant. Re-evaluate response to current plan in coming weeks. Consider physical therapy if needed.

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with some back pain.

The patient reports that he is feeling a lot of the same pain that he had when he had kidney stones about 2 years ago, so he is a little concerned. The pain started from the right side and moved over and he feels it on the left side of his back. This has been going on for the last 4 days. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but over the last 48 hours it has been constant. He has taken Tylenol, but it does not seem to help. He thinks he has hematuria, but it is hard to detect but it does look a little off color. He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen.

Regarding his migraines, he has been diligent about taking the Imitrex. He denies issues with the migraines.

Regarding his gastroesophageal reflux, he reports that he has been doing well with his diet, but notes lately with his pain, he has been eating more fast food and takeout since these options come with delivery. He is staying hydrated. He is taking Protonix 40 mg daily as directed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Gastrointestinal: Endorses abdominal pain. Endorses nausea and vomiting with exertion.
• Genitourinary: Endorses urine discoloration.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain. Endorses body aches.
• Neurological: Denies headaches. Endorses dizziness and lightheadedness.

• Additional Testing: I have ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.
• Medical Treatment: We will start him on Ultram 50 mg as needed every 6 hours for pain.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to stay well hydrated and to strain his urine.

Migraines.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with Imitrex and is doing well at this time.
• Medical Treatment: Continue Imitrex.

Reflux.
• Medical Reasoning: This is typically well-controlled with dietary modifications.
• Medical Treatment: Continue with Protonix 40 mg daily. A refill was provided.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. John Perry is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history significant for kidney stones, migraines, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presents with back pain. The patient reports experiencing pain similar to his previous kidney stones approximately two years ago, prompting concern for recurrence. The pain began on the right side of his back four days ago and has since shifted to the left side. Initially intermittent, the pain has been constant for the past 48 hours and is described as ""pretty bad."" He has attempted Tylenol for pain relief, but it has not been effective. Associated symptoms include possible blood in his urine, which appears slightly off-color but is difficult to detect. He also reports dizziness and lightheadedness accompanied by abdominal pain when exerting himself, such as climbing stairs or running.

Regarding his migraines, he reports being diligent about taking Imitrex and denies any current issues. His acid reflux is generally well-controlled with diet changes, but due to the current back pain making it difficult to go out, he has been ordering more takeout and fast food recently. He is currently taking Protonix 40 mg daily and reports staying hydrated. He notes some body aches which he attributes to favoring his back due to the pain, stating this is not unexpected based on his previous kidney stone experience.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Kidney stones, migraines, gastroesophageal reflux.

MEDICATIONS:
Imitrex (for migraines)
Protonix 40 mg daily (for reflux)
Tylenol (OTC, for pain, not effective)

ALLERGIES: None mentioned.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Not discussed.

FAMILY HISTORY: Not discussed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with exertion. Endorses body aches (attributed to favoring back).
HEENT: Denies headaches (related to migraines).
Respiratory: Denies chest pain.
Cardiovascular: Not specifically reviewed beyond general symptoms.
Gastrointestinal: Endorses abdominal pain with exertion. Endorses nausea and vomiting with exertion.
Genitourinary: Endorses possible urine discoloration.
Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain. Endorses body aches.

O:
VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure elevated (no value given).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: (Limited exam performed/discussed)
Cardiovascular: Heart sounds clear.
Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation.
Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary: CVA tenderness noted on the right. Abdomen tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant.

LABORATORY RESULTS:
Creatinine: Slightly elevated.

IMAGING RESULTS:
Abdominal X-ray: Shows possible kidney stone lower down (awaiting official read).

A:
1. Recurrent Kidney Stone: 61-year-old male presenting with acute onset, severe, shifting back pain radiating to the abdomen, similar to prior kidney stone episodes. Objective findings of right-sided CVA tenderness, right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, slightly elevated creatinine, and a possible stone noted on abdominal x-ray strongly support a diagnosis of recurrent nephrolithiasis, likely causing obstruction.
2. Migraines: Controlled on current Imitrex regimen.
3. Gastroesophageal Reflux: Generally well-controlled with Protonix 40 mg daily and dietary modifications, though recent pain has led to dietary changes. Needs refill of Protonix.

P:
1. Recurrent Kidney Stone:
    *   Diagnostics: Order CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast to confirm presence, size, and location of stone and assess for obstruction.
    *   Medications: Order Ultram 50 mg PO every 6 hours as needed for pain.
    *   Patient Education: Advised patient to push fluids and strain urine.
    *   Follow-up: Nurse will assist with scheduling the CT scan. Provider will follow up with patient in approximately 1-2 days to discuss CT results and plan. Patient instructed to call if symptoms worsen.
2. Migraines:
    *   Medications: Continue Imitrex as prescribed.
3. Gastroesophageal Reflux:
    *   Medications: Continue Protonix 40 mg PO daily. Order refill for Protonix."

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain.

The patient states he was golfing and hurt his back. This happened approximately 4 days ago when he felt a pop in his back. The patient notes that he immediately hit the ground trying to loosen up his back. He reports taking some Tylenol, ibuprofen, and using ice and heat which did not relieve the pain. By Monday morning it loosened up a little bit, but it is still pretty sore. He had some right lower extremity weakness and some drop foot that he felt that for a while, and it got a little better this morning but not much. He had surgery about 10 years ago in his lower back.

Regarding his congestive heart failure, he has been watching his diet and trying to exercise regularly. He is avoiding the salty foods and has been compliant with medications. He has gained a little weight over the summer but nothing more than 5 pounds. He has no problems lying flat to go to bed.

Regarding his diabetes, he is watching his blood sugars at home, not always consistently. He is still on his metformin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies weight loss. Endorses weight gain.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain. Endorses right leg weakness and drop foot.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.
• Musculoskeletal: Examination of his back reveals pain to palpation at L5. Decreased range of motion with flexion and extension. Positive straight leg raise. Strength is 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left.

Results:

X-ray lumbar spine, ordered and obtained in the office today, is unremarkable with good bony alignment.

Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain.

Acute lumbar strain.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports feeling a 'pop' and immediate pain while golfing approximately 4 days ago. He has tried Tylenol and ibuprofen without significant relief.
• Additional Testing: If he continues to have pain, we will obtain an MRI for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer him to physical therapy to work on strengthening the area.

Diabetes type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with metformin and dietary modifications, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was 8.
• Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in a couple of months.
• Medical Treatment: Increase metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: He is doing well from this standpoint. He has been compliant with his medications, dietary modifications, and regular physical activity.
• Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once daily and Lasix. Lisinopril was refilled today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow-up in 2 weeks.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Back pain.

**History of Present Illness:**
Mr. James Allen is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes, who presents today with back pain. The patient reports the onset of pain approximately four days ago on Saturday morning while golfing. He experienced a ""pop"" during his backswing, followed by immediate severe pain requiring him to lie on the ground to try and loosen his back. He has attempted pain relief with Tylenol, ibuprofen, ice, and heat, none of which provided significant relief. By Monday morning, the pain had loosened slightly but remains ""pretty sore."" He reports associated right lower extremity weakness and a sensation of ""drop foot"" which has improved slightly this morning but persists. He denies leg pain, numbness, or tingling. He reports a history of lower back surgery approximately 10 years ago. He is able to walk around slowly but avoids strenuous activity.

Regarding his congestive heart failure, he reports good compliance with medications (Lisinopril, Lasix) and diet, specifically avoiding salty foods. He is trying to exercise regularly. He reports a slight weight gain (<5 pounds) over the summer but denies recent significant weight gain or leg swelling. He denies problems lying flat at night.

Regarding his type 2 diabetes, he reports monitoring his blood sugars at home, though not always consistently. He is currently taking Metformin. He acknowledges a struggle with dietary compliance, particularly regarding sweets like jelly beans.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Constitutional:** Endorses slight weight gain (<5 lbs). Denies significant weight gain or loss.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Endorses back pain. Endorses right leg weakness and sensation of drop foot. Denies leg pain, numbness, or tingling.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema.
*   **Endocrine:** Endorses difficulty with strict diabetic diet compliance. Endorses home blood sugar monitoring.

**Medications:**
*   Metformin (dose/frequency not specified in transcript, but patient states he is on it)
*   Lisinopril (dose/frequency not specified in transcript, but patient states he is on it)
*   Lasix (dose/frequency not specified in transcript, but patient states he is on it)

**Allergies:**
Not specified in transcript.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Congestive Heart Failure
*   Type 2 Diabetes

**Past Surgical History:**
*   Lower back surgery (~10 years ago)

**Social History:**
Not specified in transcript.

**Family History:**
Not specified in transcript.

O:
**Vital Signs:**
Reported as ""great"" and ""completely normal"" in the office today. Specific values not provided in transcript.

**Physical Examination:**
*   **Cardiovascular:** 2/6 systolic ejection murmur appreciated, noted as stable from prior exams.
*   **Musculoskeletal (Back):** Pain to palpation of the lumbar spine at the level of L5. Decreased range of motion with flexion and extension. Positive straight leg raise.
*   **Neurological (Lower Extremity Strength):** Strength 4/5 on the right, 5/5 on the left.

**Results:**
*   **Lumbar Spine X-ray (Today):** Normal x-ray of the lumbar spine with good bony alignment. No abnormality noted.
*   **Hemoglobin A1c (Last):** 8.0% (noted as elevated).

A:
1.  **Acute Lumbar Strain:** 57-year-old male presenting with acute onset back pain following a golfing injury with a reported ""pop."" Exam reveals pain to palpation at L5, decreased lumbar ROM, positive straight leg raise, and mild right lower extremity weakness (4/5 strength). Lumbar spine x-ray is normal, ruling out significant bony pathology. Clinical presentation is consistent with an acute lumbar muscle strain. Differential diagnosis includes disc herniation, which is less likely given the normal x-ray but considered given the leg weakness and positive SLR, warranting further investigation if symptoms persist.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Patient reports home monitoring and Metformin use but struggles with dietary compliance. Recent Hemoglobin A1c of 8.0% indicates suboptimal glycemic control (goal <7%).
3.  **Congestive Heart Failure:** Patient reports good compliance with medications (Lisinopril, Lasix) and diet, with stable symptoms (no significant weight gain, no orthopnea). Cardiac exam reveals a stable 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Condition appears well-managed at this time.

P:
1.  **Acute Lumbar Strain:**
    *   **Medication:** Prescribe Meloxicam 15 mg by mouth once daily for pain and inflammation.
    *   **Physical Therapy:** Refer to physical therapy for strengthening and rehabilitation.
    *   **Further Imaging:** If symptoms persist despite initial treatment and physical therapy, order an MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate for potential disc herniation or other structural issues.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Medication Adjustment:** Increase Metformin dose to 1000 mg by mouth twice daily to improve glycemic control.
    *   **Monitoring:** Order repeat Hemoglobin A1c in a couple of months to assess response to medication change.
    *   **Education:** Reinforce importance of dietary modifications, particularly limiting sweets, and consistent home blood sugar monitoring.
3.  **Congestive Heart Failure:**
    *   **Medications:** Continue current medications: Lisinopril and Lasix.
    *   **Refill:** Refill Lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily as requested by the patient.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue monitoring symptoms (weight, swelling, orthopnea).
4.  **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in two weeks to re-evaluate back pain and review initial response to treatment."

Follow-up of chronic problems.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. It has been about 6 months since I last saw the patient.

The patient reports her arthritis is starting to get better. She has been trying to move her body with pilates and lifting weights. This has helped build up some muscles and her joint pain has reduced. The patient has also continued to attend physical therapy, which she feels has been beneficial.

Ms. Mitchell had an episode of gout of her right first big toe about 2 months ago. She states she is doing well on the allopurinol 100 mg once daily and has had no further flare ups.

Regarding her acid reflux, she was placed on omeprazole 40 mg once a day to help with some of the symptoms she was having. She started to make some dietary modifications, but she still needs to make more progress. She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning. The patient also has abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago, and it was normal. She denies blood in her stool.

The patient denies unexplained weight gain or loss, fevers, chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, melena. Endorses vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Gastrointestinal: Pain to palpation of the right upper quadrant. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs.
• Musculoskeletal: Right knee shows a little effusion. Slight pain to palpation. Some decreased range of motion.

RESULTS

Autoimmune panel is within normal limits.

X-ray of the right knee demonstrates residual arthritis. No fractures noted.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems.

Acid reflux with nausea and vomiting.
• Medical Reasoning: She reports episodes of vomiting in the morning, as well as abdominal pain and bloating. She has been compliant with omeprazole and has made a few dietary modifications.
• Additional Testing: We will order an ultrasound of her right upper quadrant, as well as additional labs, to rule out biliary etiology.
• Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 40 mg once daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications.

Gout.
• Medical Reasoning: Her flares are well controlled on allopurinol.
• Medical Treatment: Continue allopurinol 100 mg once daily. This was refilled today.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well and has remained active since her last visit. Physical therapy has also been beneficial for her. Her right knee x-ray demonstrated residual arthritis but was otherwise normal.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her to continue pilates and using the knee. She will contact me if she has any issues and we can consider further imaging or intervention at that time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up of chronic problems.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Anna Mitchell is a 44-year-old female with a past medical history significant for arthritis, gout, and reflux, who presents today for follow-up of her chronic problems. She was last seen approximately 6 months ago.

She reports her arthritis is improving since her last visit. She has been engaging in pilates and lifting weights, which she feels has helped build muscle and reduce joint pain. She completed physical therapy for her right knee and reports it was beneficial, helping her regain strength. She is now able to walk approximately 1 to 1.5 miles daily.

Regarding her gout, she reports she is doing well. She had a flare-up in her right first big toe about 2 months ago, which resolved with medication. She is currently taking allopurinol 100 mg once daily and reports no issues or further flare-ups since the last episode.

Concerning her acid reflux, she continues on omeprazole 40 mg once daily and has started making some dietary modifications, though she notes she has not fully adhered to them. She reports ongoing symptoms including episodes of vomiting in the mornings. She also endorses abdominal pain and bloating. Her last bowel movement was 2 days ago and was reported as normal. She denies blood in her stool.

She denies fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for abnormal labs.

Anemia.
• Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue. Her recent hemoglobin level was low at 8.2, but she denies any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or urinary tract bleeding, as well as any abnormal menstrual bleeding. Her colonoscopy from 3 years ago demonstrated mild diverticulosis.
• Additional Testing: We will order an anemia profile for further evaluation.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her back to gastroenterology for repeat evaluation with possible endoscopy and colonoscopy.

Congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: She has noticed some lower extremity edema. Her echocardiogram from 6 months ago demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 45%, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate Lasix 40 mg once daily, and continue with Toprol 50 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She should continue to limit her sodium intake. I advised her to monitor her daily weights and notify me if these start to increase.

Kidney stones.
• Medical Reasoning: She as asymptomatic denies any recent flare ups.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with dietary modifications and proper hydration. She will contact me with any questions or concerns.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Low hemoglobin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Stephanie Diaz is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, kidney stones, and prior colonoscopy, who presents today for evaluation of a low hemoglobin level found on recent laboratory testing. The patient reports experiencing increased fatigue and dizziness over the past couple of months. She notes feeling ""worn out"" even with activities she previously tolerated well, such as walking a mile or going to work.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive Heart Failure, Kidney Stones, Prior Colonoscopy (approx. 3 years ago for blood in stool, showed mild diverticulosis).

MEDICATIONS: (Not explicitly listed by patient in transcript)
ALLERGIES: (Not mentioned in transcript)

O:
VITAL SIGNS: Within normal limits (specific values not documented in transcript).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
• General: Physical examination looks fine (per clinician).
• Cardiovascular: Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur noted.
• Lower Extremities: Trace to 1+ pitting edema noted in the ankles bilaterally.
• Other Systems (HEENT, Lungs, Abdomen, etc.): Not specifically described in transcript.

LABORATORY/IMAGING RESULTS:
• Hemoglobin: 8.2 (recent lab).
• Echocardiogram (approx. 6 months ago): Ejection Fraction 45%, Moderate Mitral Regurgitation.

A:
1. Anemia: New finding of low hemoglobin at 8.2. Patient reports associated fatigue and dizziness. Potential sources of blood loss (GI, GYN, GU) were reviewed; patient denies recent hematochezia, melena, heavy menstrual bleeding, or hematuria. History is notable for blood in stool 3 years ago leading to colonoscopy which showed mild diverticulosis, with no issues since. Evaluation is needed to determine the specific type and cause of anemia.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: Chronic condition with reduced ejection fraction (45%) and moderate mitral regurgitation documented on prior echocardiogram. Patient reports recent difficulty with salt restriction and notes associated trace to 1+ lower extremity edema. Denies symptoms of pulmonary congestion (SOB, orthopnea).
3. Kidney Stones: History of kidney stones. Patient is currently asymptomatic, denying recent pain or hematuria.

P:
1. Anemia:
    • Labs: Order anemia profile to further evaluate the type of anemia.
    • Referral: Refer to Gastroenterology for repeat evaluation, likely including endoscopy and colonoscopy, to rule out a gastrointestinal source of blood loss.
2. Congestive Heart Failure:
    • Medications: Initiate Lasix 40 mg by mouth once daily. Continue Toprol 50 mg daily and Lisinopril 10 mg daily.
    • Patient Education: Reinforce strict salt restriction. Advise patient to obtain a scale and monitor daily weights, calling the office if weight increases, as this may indicate need for increased diuretic dose.
3. Kidney Stones:
    • Management: Continue current management. Encourage continued dietary modifications and adequate hydration.
    • Follow-up: Patient to call with any questions or concerns."

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for and prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

The patient reports he felt something in the lower right side of his back while pushing a refrigerator up through another room. This happened about 5 days ago. The patient experiences pain while bending over. He has a history of a discectomy. He is worried that something happened. He has been taking ibuprofen, which has not been beneficial alone. With the combination of Tylenol and ibuprofen, he experiences symptomatic relief. He denies numbness and tingling in his legs, and any problems with his bladder or bowels.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Denies hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, heartburn, or abdominal pain.
• Genitourinary: Denies urinary urgency, pain, or incontinence.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses lower right side back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
• Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation to the right lumbar spine and the paraspinal muscles. Decreased flexion and extension of the back. Positive straight leg raise on the right. Strength is good bilaterally in the lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray of the lumbar spine is unremarkable. Normal bony alignment. No fractures were noted.

Labs: Within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for prior discectomy, who presents with back pain.

Lumbar strain.
• Medical Reasoning: He reports right-sided low back after moving a refrigerator approximately 5 days ago. X-ray of his lumbar spine is unremarkable. I do not believe this is related to his previous discectomy.
• Additional Testing: We will order a MRI of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.
• Medical Treatment: Initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily, as well as Ultram 50 mg every 4 hours as needed.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer him to physical therapy to be started after we get his MRI results back.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to discontinue the use of ibuprofen, but he may continue using Tylenol if he wishes.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Back pain.

**History of Present Illness:**
Mr. Bryan Smith is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history significant for prior discectomy, who presents with back pain. The patient reports that approximately five days ago, while helping his wife move a refrigerator, he felt something in the lower right side of his back. He describes the pain as being in the lower right side of his back and states it hurts to bend over. He has been taking ibuprofen, which alone did not provide significant relief. He found some relief when taking a combination of Tylenol and ibuprofen. He expresses concern that the current issue may be related to his prior discectomy. He denies any associated pain, numbness, or tingling in his legs. He also denies any problems with his bladder or bowels.

**Past Medical History:**
- Prior discectomy (details not specified in transcript)

**Past Surgical History:**
- Prior discectomy (details not specified in transcript)

**Family History:**
- Not discussed in transcript.

**Social History:**
- Not discussed in transcript.

**Review of Systems:**
- General: Denies other symptoms (when asked about chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting).
- Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
- Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
- Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
- Genitourinary: Denies problems with bladder or bowels.
- Musculoskeletal: Endorses lower right side back pain. Denies leg pain, numbness, or tingling.

**Medications:**
- Ibuprofen (OTC, patient-reported use)
- Tylenol (OTC, patient-reported use)

**Allergies:**
- Not discussed in transcript.

O:
**Vital Signs:**
- Vital signs noted as ""really good"" in the office. Patient is afebrile, blood pressure ""nice and controlled."" (Specific values not provided in transcript).

**Physical Examination:**
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm. Heart sounds noted as ""great."" (No murmurs, gallops, rubs mentioned).
- **Respiratory:** Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- **Musculoskeletal (Back):** Pain to palpation of the right lumbar spine in the paraspinal muscles. Decreased flexion and extension of the back. Positive straight leg raise on the right. Strength is good bilaterally in the lower extremities.

**Results:**
- **Lumbar Spine X-ray:** Unremarkable. Good bony alignment. No fracture noted.
- **Labs:** Labs noted as ""all look good."" (Specific values not provided in transcript).

A:
**1. Lumbar Strain**
- **Assessment:** 55-year-old male presenting with acute onset right lower back pain following a lifting/pushing mechanism. Subjective report of pain aggravated by bending is consistent with musculoskeletal strain. Objective findings include pain to palpation of the right lumbar paraspinal muscles, decreased range of motion, and a positive straight leg raise on the right, notably without associated lower extremity weakness, numbness, or tingling. Lumbar spine X-ray is unremarkable for fracture or significant bony abnormality.
- **Differential Diagnosis:** Given the patient's history of prior discectomy and initial concern, complication related to prior surgery was considered. However, the absence of neurological deficits (normal strength, denial of numbness/tingling, negative bladder/bowel symptoms) and the negative X-ray make this less likely at this time, favoring a diagnosis of lumbar strain.

P:
**1. Lumbar Strain:**
- **Further Evaluation:** Order MRI of the lumbar spine to further evaluate and rule out other potential issues, particularly given the history of prior surgery.
- **Medications:**
    - Prescribe Meloxicam 15 mg by mouth once daily.
    - Prescribe Ultram (Tramadol) 50 mg by mouth every four hours as needed for pain.
- **Patient Education/Medication Management:** Advised patient to discontinue ibuprofen. Patient may continue taking Tylenol if desired.
- **Referral:** Refer to physical therapy to begin after MRI results are available.
- **Follow-up:** Advised patient to call if needed. No specific return visit scheduled in transcript."

Roger Nelson is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up for chest pain. The patient was doing yard work over the weekend when he began to feel short of breath and a full chest pain for approximately hour. He denies a history of chest pain. The patient notes that after he finished he felt fine. He has not had any other symptoms since that time. He denies a family history of heart disease.

The patient underwent right knee surgery a couple of months ago and has been feeling well since then. He has been in rehab and recovery. He denies chest pain while doing exercises in physical therapy for his knee.

His blood pressure was noted to be 180/95 mmHg when he visited the emergency room. He notes that his blood pressure has not been as high as usual.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Neck
• General Examination: I do feel a little large thyroid that is not tender. She has a carotid bruit on the right side. 

Respiratory
• Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. Cardiovascular
• Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, but I do hear 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Gastrointestinal
• Examination of Abdomen: Soft. There is a healed scar on the right knee from prior knee surgery. Musculoskeletal
• Examination: There is no lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Blood pressure is elevated.

EKG is normal.

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for emergency room follow-up. He presented to the emergency room for chest pain and elevated blood pressure of 180/95. His EKG from the emergency room was normal, but ejection fraction on echocardiogram was abnormal. His blood pressure today was still elevated.

Chest pain and hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: Given his recent episode of blood pressure elevation and chest pain, I suspect an element of coronary artery disease as well as pumping dysfunction.
• Medical Treatment: We will change his blood pressure regimen to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day. He should also continue lisinopril 10 mg a day and I want to see how his blood pressure does on that regimen. I also recommended cardiac catheterization on him to make sure that he does not have any blockages in his heart.

4.  Right Carotid Bruit
5.  Systolic Ejection Murmur
6.  Enlarged Thyroid

**Assessment:** 62-year-old male presenting for follow-up of exertional chest discomfort and shortness of breath that prompted an ER visit. At the ER, he was found to have significantly elevated blood pressure (180/95 mmHg), a normal EKG, and decreased ejection fraction on echocardiogram. His blood pressure remains elevated today. Given the episode of chest pain, severe hypertension, and reduced cardiac pumping function, the clinician suspects this could be related to severe hypertension or underlying heart disease, including potential coronary artery disease. Other findings include a right carotid bruit, a systolic ejection murmur, and a non-tender enlarged thyroid.

P:
**Plan:**
*   **Chest Pain / Possible Coronary Artery Disease / Decreased Ejection Fraction:**
    *   Order cardiac catheterization to evaluate for blockages in the coronary arteries.
*   **Hypertension / Decreased Ejection Fraction:**
    *   Adjust blood pressure regimen: Add Carvedilol 25 mg twice daily. Continue Lisinopril 10 mg daily.
    *   Rationale: Carvedilol helps with coronary disease and cardiac pumping function.
    *   Monitor blood pressure response to the new regimen.
*   **Follow-up:**
    *   Schedule cardiac catheterization.
    *   Follow up as needed based on blood pressure control and cath results."

Follow-up from an emergency room visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Louis Williams is a 58-year-old male presenting for a follow-up from an emergency room visit.

The patient states that he was playing tennis on Saturday, that he was really hot and that after approximately 30 minutes he was struggling to breathe. He states that he thought he was having a heart attack at that time. His wife took him to the emergency room and at that time, he states that he had been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy. He notes that on Sunday he felt fine.

The patient reports that he has been very diligent with his medications for his congestive heart failure. He notes that he has been avoiding salt for the most part but there has been some dietary indiscretion more recently.

He is status post cataract extraction approximately 3 months ago, and notes that everything has been fine since then. He denies any vision problems at this time.

The patient had a skin cancer removed approximately 5 months ago. He reports this is well healed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Endorse dyspnea on exertion.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath.
• Neurological: Endorses lightheadedness and dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Neck: Supple. No jugular venous distention.
• Respiratory: Fine crackles bilaterally.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. Bilateral lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

ECG revealed left ventricular hypertrophy consistent with congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram demonstrates stable diminished ejection fraction.
Skin cancer pathology demonstrates clear margins.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for follow-up after emergency room visit.

ED follow-up and congestive heart failure.
• Medical Reasoning: I believe his symptoms which led to his ED visit were due to an exacerbation of his heart failure. He admits to some dietary indiscretion, which likely resulted in fluid retention.
• Medical Treatment: I will prescribe Lasix 80 mg once a day. I will also place him on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.

Status post basal cell carcinoma removal.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well and the removal site is well-healed. No change in treatment is necessary at this time.

Status post cataract surgery.
• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well. We will continue to observe, but no treatment changes are needed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up from emergency room visit for shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Louis Williams is a 58-year-old male presenting for follow-up after an emergency room visit on Saturday for acute onset shortness of breath while playing tennis. He reports that it was very hot and humid that day. After approximately 30 minutes of playing, he became very short of breath and struggled to breathe, leading him to believe he was having a heart attack. His wife took him to the emergency room where ""everything checked out."" Approximately six hours after returning home from the ER on Saturday, he felt very lightheaded and dizzy. He reports feeling fine on Sunday. He denies any vision problems since his cataract surgery. He reports the site of his skin cancer removal is well healed with no problems.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Congestive Heart Failure
- Status post cataract extraction (~3 months ago)
- Status post skin cancer removal (~5 months ago)

MEDICATIONS:
- Heart failure medications (patient reports taking diligently, specific names/doses not mentioned)

ALLERGIES:
- Not specified in transcript.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
- Plays tennis.
- Reports generally avoiding salty foods but admits to some recent dietary indiscretion.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
- General: Reports feeling fine on Sunday after the episode.
- Cardiovascular: Endorses dyspnea on exertion (while playing tennis), reports thinking he was having a heart attack during the episode.
- Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath (while playing tennis).
- Neurological: Endorses lightheadedness and dizziness (~6 hours post-ER visit Saturday).

O:
VITAL SIGNS:
- Blood Pressure: High (specific value not mentioned, noted as high in ER report as well).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
- Neck: Supple, no fibular venous distention (likely transcription error for jugular venous distention).
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
- Respiratory: Fine crackles bilaterally.
- Extremities: Trace lower extremity edema in both legs.

RESULTS:
- ECG (reviewed): Stable, shows left ventricular hypertrophy.
- Echocardiogram (reviewed): Pumping function of heart is a little low, but stable.
- Skin Biopsy Pathology Report (reviewed): Looks like they got all of the skin cancer, everything is fine.

A:
1. Congestive Heart Failure, exacerbation: 58-year-old male with history of CHF presenting for follow-up after ER visit for acute shortness of breath. Symptoms occurred while playing tennis in heat/humidity. Objective findings include high blood pressure, bilateral fine crackles, and trace bilateral lower extremity edema. Review of prior studies shows stable LVH on ECG and stable low ejection fraction on echocardiogram. Patient admits to recent dietary indiscretion. Clinical picture is consistent with a likely exacerbation of heart failure due to fluid retention from increased salt intake.
2. Status post cataract extraction (~3 months ago): Patient reports everything has been fine since surgery with no vision problems. Exam not discussed.
3. Status post skin cancer removal (~5 months ago): Patient reports site is well healed with no problems. Pathology report reviewed confirms clear margins.

P:
1. Congestive Heart Failure, exacerbation:
    - Medications:
        - Lasix 80 mg by mouth once daily.
        - Carvedilol 25 mg by mouth twice daily.
    - Patient Education: Discussed likely cause of exacerbation related to dietary indiscretion and fluid retention.
2. Status post cataract extraction: Continue to observe. No medication adjustments needed.
3. Status post skin cancer removal: Continue to observe. No medication adjustments needed.
- Follow-up: Nurse will see patient soon."

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 48-year-old female who presents for shortness of breath. She has a history of depression, smoking and chronic back pain.

The patient reports shortness of breath with mild exercise and walking. She also notes some palpitations at times. She is not sure if it is due to her back pain or not. The patient states she has been exercising more. She continues to smoke but has decreased from two packs a day down to a couple of cigarettes daily.

Regarding her depression, the patient feels that it is well managed on Effexor.

Regarding her chronic back pain, the patient has been taking Neurontin, which she states is helping control her pain. She states she tries to get as much rest as she can. She is no longer doing yoga as she has not made it a habit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular: Endorses dyspnea on exertion. Endorses palpitations.
• Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath.
• Musculoskeletal: Endorses back pain.
• Integumentary:
• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Mild wheezes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test demonstrates mild asthma and the appearance of COPD.

X-ray of the chest demonstrates flattening of the diaphragm which is consistent with COPD.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

COPD.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with shortness of breath with exertion. Her pulmonary function tests suggest asthma or COPD and her most recent chest x-ray and physical examination today are also consistent with COPD.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I counseled the patient on the importance of smoking cessation.
• Medical Treatment: We will start the patient on Combivent, 2 puffs twice a day. I will also prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed, and a prednisone taper pack.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: It sounds like her depression is stable, so we will not change anything at this time.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She will keep taking the Effexor. I encouraged her to practice yoga for depression relief as well as her back pain.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient says she is doing well on Neurontin with only occasional exacerbation of the pain.
• Medical Treatment: She can continue Neurontin as is. I also encouraged her to practice yoga for her back pain.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:

[doctor] all right . let's uh , let's look at your x-ray .
[doctor] hey dragon . show me the last radiograph . so this is looking at your right arm , and what i see is a proximal humerus fracture . so you kinda think of your humerus as a snow cone , and you knocked the-
[patient] the top of the snow cone ?

Right upper arm pain.

HPI:

Ms. Russell is a 39-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of severe right upper arm pain. She states she was playing volleyball yesterday and fell and landed on her arm. She has been taking ibuprofen every 6 hours but it does not help. She rates her pain 9/10. She denies any numbness or tingling in her arm. She has a history of gallstones and takes Pepcid. She has a past surgical history of a lumbar fusion 6 years ago. She denies any allergies.

EXAM

Examination of the right upper extremity shows swelling and erythema of the right shoulder. Tenderness over the right shoulder. Normal pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right humerus, 2 views, obtained on today's visit show a proximal humerus fracture.

IMPRESSION

Right proximal humerus fracture.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended we place her into a long arm cast and sling. She will follow up in 2 weeks for repeat imaging. At that point, we may need to discuss surigical options. I will prescribe Lortab, 5 mg, #20 (twenty) to take every 6 hours as needed for pain.

All questions were answered.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Severe right upper arm pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Russell is a 39-year-old female presenting with severe right upper arm pain. The pain began approximately 18 hours ago, yesterday evening around 7:00 PM, following a fall during a volleyball game. While attempting to spike the ball, her legs were kicked out from under her, causing her to fall and land directly on her right shoulder/upper arm. She describes the pain as severe, rating it a 9 out of 10. She has attempted to manage the pain with ibuprofen 6 hours ago, but reports it has not provided any relief. She denies any associated numbness or tingling in the affected arm.

**Past Medical History:**
- Gallstones

**Past Surgical History:**
- Lumbar fusion (approximately 6 years ago)

**Medications:**
- Pepcid (for gallstones)
- Ibuprofen (taken for current pain, not effective)

**Allergies:**
- No known drug allergies reported.

**Review of Systems:**
- General: Denies fever, chills, weight changes (not discussed).
- Musculoskeletal: Severe right upper arm pain (9/10), swelling, tenderness, erythema of right shoulder. Denies numbness or tingling in the right arm.
- Other systems not specifically reviewed in the transcript.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Not documented in transcript.

**Physical Examination:**
- Right Upper Extremity: Swelling and erythema noted over the right shoulder. Tenderness elicited over the right shoulder. Normal pulses present in the right arm. Range of motion limited due to pain, but able to straighten elbow without moving shoulder. Remainder of physical exam described as generally normal.

**Imaging:**
- X-ray Right Humerus (2 views, today): Demonstrates a proximal humerus fracture.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Right Proximal Humerus Fracture:** Acute fracture sustained following a fall during volleyball. Pain is severe (9/10) and poorly controlled with ibuprofen. Objective findings of swelling, erythema, and tenderness over the fracture site are consistent with the diagnosis confirmed by X-ray. The fracture location (proximal humerus) was discussed, noting that these types of fractures often heal without surgical intervention.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Right Proximal Humerus Fracture:**
    *   **Management:** Discussed diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options with the patient. Decision made to proceed with non-surgical management at this time.
    *   **Immobilization:** Apply a long arm cast and sling to immobilize the fracture and provide traction.
    *   **Pain Control:** Prescribe Lortab 5 mg, #20 tablets. Instructed patient to take 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain.
    *   **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 2 weeks for repeat X-rays to assess bone alignment. If alignment is not satisfactory at that time, surgical options will be discussed.
    *   **Patient Education:** Educated patient on the nature of the fracture, the rationale for casting/sling, pain management with prescribed medication, and the importance of follow-up for reassessment and potential discussion of surgery if needed.
    *   All patient questions were answered."

[patient] this was just yesterday .
[doctor] all right . and have you tried anything for it ? i mean ...
[patient] i put ice on it . and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it still hurts at lot .
[doctor] okay , what makes it better or worse ?
[patient] the ice , when i have it on , is better .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but , um , as soon as , you know , i take it off then it starts throbbing and hurting again .

[patient] yes . yes , i do . yeah .
[doctor] do you take any medications for it ?

all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .
so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ?
[patient] yes , it is .
[doctor] okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ?

[doctor] all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can .
[patient] that's about it .
[doctor] all right .

[doctor] okay . so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicondyle . uh , you have some swelling there and some redness . uh , you have some pain with flexion , extension of your elbow as well . uh , and you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your- of your forearm as well . okay ? so let's look at your x-rays . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . your x-ray of your elbow-
it looks like , i mean , the bones are lined up properly . there's no fracture-
[doctor] . it , uh , there's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow but i do n't see any fracture , so that's good . so , looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam , uh , my diagnosis here would be lateral epicondylitis , and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in- inserts . and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes . so we'll try some motrin , uh , about 800 milligrams every six hours . uh , i'll give you a sling for comfort , just so you can use it if- if it's causing a lot of pain .

[patient] it does . you're the doctor . i do n't know what it is .
[doctor] so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach .

[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up regarding medication costs, weight gain, acne, and recent lab results.

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female presenting for follow-up. She reports difficulty affording previously prescribed medications. She has not started the Unithroid prescribed at her last visit due to a cost of $75 at Walmart pharmacy and continues taking her previous thyroid medication. She did not initially use the discount coupon provided but will try a new one given today, which is expected to reduce the cost significantly (to ~$9 for 90 days). She also did not fill the Epiduo gel prescription for acne due to a cost of $100 at Walmart. She asks if trying a different pharmacy or prescribing individual ingredients might be cheaper.

She continues to experience abnormal weight gain since her last visit. She questioned if her prior birth control (Microgestin, now discontinued) could be the cause. She denies trying significant dietary changes since the last visit but plans to resume gym attendance in July after a contract ends and vacation begins. She inquired about the potential benefits for weight loss of CLA, chromium, and amino acids, stating a coworker suggested chromium and a cousin suggested CLA and amino acids. She understands that chromium is a supplement unlikely to help significantly and that taking it or CLA might exclude her from a weight loss study. She understands amino acids are components of protein and unlikely to aid weight loss but may help with hydration/replenishment.

She reports sensitive skin and develops rashes with various products. She denies ever using topical treatments for her acne, including topical clindamycin.

She reports significant foot swelling. She also reports chronic constipation, which she manages with MiraLAX as previously recommended by a doctor.

She confirms she is currently taking her prescribed high-dose Vitamin D but needs to take today's dose.

**Past Medical History:** Hypothyroidism, Acne Vulgaris, Vitamin D deficiency, Abnormal weight gain, Hirsutism, Constipation.

**Social History:** Patient plans to resume gym attendance in July. Diet changes have been attempted but not consistently maintained.

**Review of Systems:**
General: Reports abnormal weight gain.
Cardiovascular: Reports foot swelling.
Gastrointestinal: Reports constipation.
Skin: Reports acne, sensitive skin, rashes with products, hirsutism.

**Current Medications:**
Previous thyroid medication (name not specified)
Vitamin D (high dose, specific dose not specified)
MiraLAX (frequency not specified)

**Allergies:** No known allergies (NKDA).

O:
**Vital Signs:** Not documented in transcript.
**Physical Exam:**
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally (verbalized as ""sounds good"").
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm (verbalized as ""sounds good"").
Extremities: Feet and ankles examined, appear normal today (""look okay right now"").
Other exams relevant to CC (e.g., skin exam for acne/hirsutism, abdominal exam) not documented in transcript.

**Laboratory Results (Discussed):**
Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.
Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 normal, 1 abnormal. Not consistent with Cushing's Syndrome.
Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128 (previous values: 254 in Oct, ~200 not long ago, dropped in Jan and Mar). Liver enzymes improved since discontinuation of birth control in Dec.
Lipid Panel: Total Cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL (goal <100), non-HDL 178 mg/dL (goal <130). HDL goal >50.
Screen for Diabetes: Fine (specific test/value not mentioned).
Vitamin D: Deficiency noted (specific value not mentioned).
Pituitary Hormones: Appeared good and in decent range (specific tests/values not mentioned).
Iron Levels: Appeared good and in decent range (specific tests/values not mentioned).
Free Androgen Index (FAI): Normal.

A:
1.  **Hypothyroidism:** Patient continues on previous thyroid medication due to cost barrier with Unithroid. Labs will be repeated before next visit to assess current levels.
2.  **Abnormal Liver Enzymes:** Improved significantly since discontinuation of oral contraceptive (Microgestin). Current ALT 128, down from previous values up to 254. Continued improvement expected with weight loss.
3.  **Abnormal Weight Gain:** Extensive endocrine workup (Dexamethasone suppression test, salivary cortisol, FAI, growth hormone, pituitary hormones) has been largely negative, ruling out Cushing's syndrome and making an endocrine cause less likely. Patient is interested in weight loss strategies including diet, exercise, and potentially a weight loss study.
4.  **Acne Vulgaris:** Patient has sensitive skin and has not used topical treatments previously. Epiduo was cost-prohibitive. Will attempt treatment with individual components.
5.  **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Patient is on high-dose supplementation and will transition to maintenance dose.
6.  **Hirsutism:** Androgen levels (FAI) are normal, making an androgenic cause less likely.
7.  **Constipation:** Chronic issue, currently managed with MiraLAX.
8.  **Dyslipidemia/Hypercholesterolemia:** Elevated Total Cholesterol, LDL, and non-HDL, with low HDL based on recent lipid panel. Requires management with diet and lifestyle changes.

P:
1.  **Hypothyroidism:** Patient provided prescription for Unithroid and a discount card. Advised to try different pharmacies (e.g., CVS) to find a better price. Will contact office if cost remains prohibitive. Repeat thyroid levels (and other labs) ordered before next visit.
2.  **Abnormal Liver Enzymes:** Continue monitoring. Improvement noted since OCP discontinuation. Encourage continued weight loss efforts.
3.  **Abnormal Weight Gain:**
    *   Discussed participation in weight loss study (criteria: BMI >30 or >27 with comorbidity like hypercholesterolemia; involves weekly injection of diabetes medication acting on satiety; 6 arms including placebo; 1-year duration; weekly visits initially, then monthly; stipend provided; parking validated; exclusion: diabetes, psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia/bipolar). Patient will consider and call research office within a month if interested. Information for research office provided.
    *   Advised dietary modifications: low-carbohydrate diet, low-cholesterol diet, avoid alcohol, avoid fatty foods.
    *   Discussed patient's inquiries about supplements: Advised CLA and chromium are unlikely to help significantly and may exclude from study. Amino acids are components of protein and unlikely to aid weight loss but may help with replenishment.
4.  **Acne Vulgaris:** Prescribed Clindamycin gel and Benzoyl Peroxide separately due to cost issues with Epiduo. Instructed patient to apply at night to avoid sun sensitivity and cautioned about potential bleaching of sheets with Benzoyl Peroxide.
5.  **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Patient to complete current high-dose course, then transition to Vitamin D 2000 IU daily for maintenance. Vitamin D level will not be rechecked in the near future.
6.  **Hirsutism:** No specific intervention planned at this time given normal androgen levels.
7.  **Constipation:** Continue MiraLAX as needed.
8.  **Dyslipidemia/Hypercholesterolemia:** Addressed with dietary recommendations (low-cholesterol, avoid fatty foods). Repeat lipid panel ordered before next visit.
9.  **Foot Swelling:** Advised patient to monitor and notify doctor if swelling worsens or reoccurs.
10. **Birth Control:** Offered Phexxi (spermicide) as an alternative birth control method following discontinuation of OCP. Patient will notify office if needed.
11. **Follow-up:** Repeat labs (thyroid, liver enzymes, lipids, etc.) ordered before next visit. Patient to call research office within a month if interested in weight loss study. Patient to call office if issues with medication costs. Return visit as needed or planned."
virtscribe,D2N022,"[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , "" fds tendon , "" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .
[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .
[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?
[patient] i'm good , how about you ?
[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?
[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .
[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?
[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .
[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?
[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .
[doctor] yeah , i see that .
[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .
[doctor] what do you do for a living ?
[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .
[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?
[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .
[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?
[patient] uh , that's correct .
[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .
[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?
[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .
[doctor] all right , how about here ?
[patient] um , there , it's not .
[doctor] okay , not as bad ?
[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .
[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .
[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .
[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?
[patient] ow , .
[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .
[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .
[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .
[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .
[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .
[patient] so the good one is good ?
[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .
[patient] okay , all right .
[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .
[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .
[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .
[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .
[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .
[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .
[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .
[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...
[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?
[patient] uh , not at the moment .
[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .
[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?
[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .
[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Employed as x-ray technician.

ALLERGIES

Methylprednisolone causes itching.
Dexamethasone causes palpitations.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

Occupational therapy as prescribed.","S:
**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Right index finger pain and stiffness following hyperextension injury.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:** Mr. Philip Gutierrez is a 50-year-old male presenting for a second opinion regarding pain and stiffness in his right index finger. Approximately three months ago, in March 2021, he sustained a hyperextension injury to the right index finger while a passenger in a motor vehicle accident where his vehicle was rear-ended multiple times. He reports feeling two bumps which caused him to be slung forward, resulting in the injury. He describes the pain as a pulling, tearing sensation, which has been present since the accident. The pain is exacerbated by driving and attempting to make a fist, which he is currently unable to do. He notes persistent swelling in the finger. He has been seen at another orthopedic practice, where he underwent physical/occupational therapy and had an MRI. He reports confusion regarding previous recommendations for injection vs. surgery and feels he is not receiving adequate care, particularly being told not to move the finger. He has attempted using a splint, believing it would help straighten the finger, but found it immobilizing. He is right-hand dominant and works as an x-ray technician, which requires use of his hands.

**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:** Hypertension. Denies history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.

**PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:** Not discussed.

**FAMILY HISTORY:** Not discussed.

**SOCIAL HISTORY:** Employed as an x-ray technician.

**MEDICATIONS:** Takes a blood pressure pill (name, dose, frequency not specified). Denies taking other chronic medications of significance.

**ALLERGIES:**
Methylprednisolone: Itching
Dexamethasone: Heart racing/palpitations

**REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:**
*   **General:** No distress noted.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Right index finger pain, stiffness, swelling, inability to make a fist.
*   **Endocrine:** Denies diabetes.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Denies chest pain, palpitations (except with Dexamethasone).

O:
**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
*   **Constitutional:** Very pleasant, cooperative, healthy male in no distress.
*   **Cardiovascular:** Heart rate regular rate and rhythm. 2+ radial pulses bilaterally.
*   **Neurological:** Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.
*   **Musculoskeletal (Right Hand):** No swelling or bruising noted in the palm over the volar surface of the index finger. Normal creases present. The index finger rests in approximately 10 degrees of PIP joint flexion. Correction of this position is uncomfortable. Pain is elicited with attempted active flexion of the index finger, described by the patient as a tearing sensation. Pain is also elicited with passive flexion at the MCP joint. Active and passive range of motion is limited due to pain and stiffness. Collateral ligaments and extensor tendons appear intact based on clinical assessment and prior imaging review.

**IMAGING:**
*   **X-rays (Right Hand, 4 views, today):** No bony abnormalities, joint congruency throughout all lesser digits, no soft tissue shadows of concern, no arthritis.
*   **MRI (Right Index Finger, 04/24/2021):** Reviewed. Shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS tendon, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact, as was the MCP joint capsule. Extensor tendons were deemed intact.

**PROCEDURE (Attempted Right Index Trigger Finger Injection):**
Attempted injection of 1.0 cc Celestone with 0.5 cc Lidocaine into the flexor tendon sheath. Patient had a dramatic and painful reaction to needle introduction with hand contortions and withdrawal, raising concern for secondary needle stick. Needle was withdrawn. Patient was counseled on the importance of the injection. A second attempt was made using the same technique and medication volumes. A small palmar vein bled a scant amount, which was cleaned and a Band-Aid applied. Patient was reassured no harm was done.

A:
**ASSESSMENT:**
1.  **Post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis, right index finger:** 50-year-old male presenting with chronic pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the right index finger following a hyperextension injury 3 months prior. Subjective report of pain with movement and inability to make a fist correlates with objective findings of limited active/passive ROM, pain with flexion, and a resting PIP flexion deformity. MRI findings confirm focal soft tissue swelling, tenosynovitis around the flexor tendons (FDP and FDS), and a partial tear of the FDS tendon. X-rays rule out bony injury or arthritis. The clinical picture, combined with imaging, is consistent with significant post-traumatic inflammation and scar tissue around the flexor tendons, particularly the FDS, blocking normal excursion through the pulley system, leading to stenosing tenosynovitis. The partial FDS tear is noted but considered less clinically significant given it is a partial tear of the less important of the two flexor tendons.

P:
**PLAN:**
1.  **Post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis, right index finger:**
    *   **Injection:** Attempted right index trigger finger injection with Betamethasone (Celestone) 1.0 cc and Lidocaine 0.5 cc today. Despite patient discomfort and difficulty, a second attempt was made to deliver the steroid into the flexor tendon sheath.
    *   **Medications:** Recommend icing the finger this evening and taking Ibuprofen for pain and inflammation.
    *   **Patient Education:** Discussed the diagnosis of stenosing tenosynovitis, the role of scar tissue and inflammation, and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system. Explained that the partial FDS tear is not the primary issue and the more important FDP tendon is intact. Counseled on the purpose of the steroid injection to reduce inflammation and pain, which should facilitate movement. Explained the expected timeline for injection benefit (3-5 days to start, improving over weeks). Emphasized the critical importance of active and passive range of motion exercises to combat stiffness and scar tissue, reassuring the patient that he will not tear or break anything by moving the finger due to intact ligaments and extensors. Discussed driving safety post-injection (safe, may feel strange).
    *   **Therapy:** Prescribed outpatient occupational therapy 1x/week for 6 weeks. Goal is to achieve full active and passive range of motion of the right index finger with no restrictions. Encouraged returning to the previous therapy provider, anticipating better progress after the injection.
    *   **Follow-up:** Discussed potential need to repeat the injection if symptoms persist or recur. No specific follow-up appointment scheduled, but plan includes therapy and potential repeat injection."

[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .
[patient] okay , thank you .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Hypogonadism.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, presenting today for follow-up of hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. His notable history includes HIV. He also expresses concern regarding gynecomastia, which was planned for discussion today.

Patient reports feeling well overall on current testosterone therapy, stating it is helping. He feels good, more vigorous, and is sleeping well. He believes the therapy is having positive effects, particularly on his bloodwork. He notes his triglycerides, which were previously elevated (up to 265 mg/dL), have significantly decreased to 145 mg/dL, and questions if this improvement is related to the testosterone therapy. He also reports his red blood cell count has increased, which he states is stable. He denies weight changes, stating he is ""pretty much the same as always been.""

He is currently on testosterone cypionate 1 mL every 10 days (approximately 140 mg/week). He inquired about increasing his dose to 175 mg/week. He recalls having injected testosterone shortly before his last lab draw on 11/24/2020, when his testosterone level was >1500 ng/dL. He confirms continued daily use of Finasteride (taking half of a 5 mg pill) and Cialis (5 mg on workout days, 2.5 mg on non-workout days) and requests refills for both. He uses a medication calendar to aid compliance. He states he is taking steps to ""get his life together.""

He inquired about the potential benefits of Indole-3-carbinol (broccoli extract) for estrogen control, having heard it could improve estrogen levels.

A:
1.  **Hypogonadism:** Patient is currently managed with testosterone cypionate 1 mL every 10 days and reports symptomatic improvement (increased vigor, improved sleep). Objective data shows improved triglycerides and stable PSA. However, prior peak testosterone levels (>1500 ng/dL) raise concern for potential complications like increased blood thickness. Patient's request to increase dose to 175 mg/week is declined due to the risk of exacerbating high peak levels and associated complications.
2.  **Elevated Triglycerides (Improved):** Patient notes significant improvement in triglycerides (265 -> 145 mg/dL) since starting testosterone therapy and questions if it is related. While data on testosterone's direct impact on cholesterol/triglycerides is not robust, the observed improvement is noted.
3.  **Gynecomastia:** Patient concern noted, but no specific assessment or plan discussed in transcript.
4.  **Patient Inquiry regarding Estrogen Control/Indole-3-carbinol:** Patient inquired about Indole-3-carbinol for estrogen control. Clinician advised against it, noting lack of consistent evidence and patient's previously normal estradiol levels.

P:
1.  **Hypogonadism:**
    *   Continue testosterone cypionate 1 mL every 10 days.
    *   Patient educated on risks of increasing testosterone dose, specifically related to high peak levels (>1500 ng/dL) and potential for increased blood thickness.
    *   Continue annual PSA monitoring.
    *   Consider annual estradiol check in the fall if patient desires, though levels were previously normal.
2.  **Medication Refills:**
    *   Provide paper prescriptions for Cialis and Finasteride as requested by the patient.
3.  **Gynecomastia:** No specific plan discussed in transcript.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow up bilateral reduction mammoplasty.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 36-year-old female status post bilateral reduction mammoplasty on 10/10/2020, presenting for routine postoperative follow-up. Patient reports she is doing well and her breasts feel great. She denies chills, fever, nausea, or vomiting. She reports resolution of previous back pain. Patient was last seen in clinic by PA Ruth Sanchez in March 2021, at which time a lump was noted under the left breast. Patient reports she has not felt the lump since that visit and attributes resolution to massage. Patient expresses concern regarding the appearance of her breast scars, noting they are bothersome. She previously used scar gel daily.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None discussed.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bilateral reduction mammoplasty (10/10/2020).
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory (family good).
SOCIAL HISTORY: Noncontributory (enjoying summer).
ALLERGIES: Not documented/discussed.

MEDICATIONS: Mederma scar gel (frequency previously daily, advised BID today).

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General: Denies fever, chills.
GI: Denies nausea, vomiting.
Musculoskeletal: Denies back pain.
Breast: Reports breasts feel great, previous lump resolved, concerned about scar appearance.

O:
VITALS: Not documented/discussed.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Breast: Bilateral breast incisions are well healed with no signs of infection or erythema. Noted widening of bilateral lower pole scars.

LABS/IMAGING: None discussed.

A:
1. Status post bilateral reduction mammoplasty with bilateral scar widening. Patient is healing well overall with well-healed incisions. The noted scar widening is a cosmetic concern for the patient. Surgical revision (excision and re-closure) is the definitive treatment for scar widening but is deferred until at least one year post-op.
2. Resolved left breast lump. Previously noted lump under the left breast by PA in March 2021 has resolved, likely representing resolving scar tissue or hematoma from surgery.

P:
1. Status post bilateral reduction mammoplasty with bilateral scar widening:
    *   Continue Mederma scar gel to scars twice daily (BID).
    *   Continue scar massage to scars.
    *   Obtain bilateral breast photos today for documentation and monitoring.
    *   Discussed potential future surgical revision for scar widening, but advised to wait until >1 year post-op for scar maturation.
    *   Follow up in 6 months to re-evaluate scar appearance and discuss potential revision options if desired.
2. Resolved left breast lump:
    *   No specific intervention needed as resolved. Reassured patient this was likely related to healing/scar tissue.

Return Precautions: Return sooner if signs of infection (increasing redness, swelling, pain, drainage, fever) or other new concerns arise."
virtscribe,D2N025,"[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","S:
**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Follow-up for chronic congestive heart failure and pre-operative evaluation for right knee replacement.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:** Ms. Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female presenting for follow-up regarding chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction and pre-operative evaluation for upcoming right knee replacement surgery. She has a history of CHF exacerbation earlier this spring, with BNP levels rising from 3000 in March to 6000 in April, associated with increasing dyspnea. Her CHF regimen was adjusted at that time, changing furosemide to torsemide 20 mg daily, and increasing lisinopril to 10 mg daily. She is not currently taking a potassium supplement.

She is scheduled for right knee replacement surgery on June 24th at East Metropolitan Hospital. The current visit is to optimize her cardiovascular status prior to surgery to avoid postponement.

Since her last visit in April, she reports a weight loss of approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds, which she feels is positive and may include some water weight reduction. She also notes improved urinary urgency with oxybutynin.

She reports experiencing bilateral leg cramps ""the other day"" in both legs upon waking, which she attributed possibly to being cold. She treated the cramps by drinking approximately 4 ounces of pickle juice, which resolved the symptoms. She finds this more effective than topical creams.

She confirms she is still taking an iron supplement and denies any issues with bowel function.

Regarding a history of heartburn, she denies any current problems. She states it was severe for a while in January, for which she tried Prilosec for two weeks and then stopped it, returning to her original ""stomach one"" medication. She has had no heartburn issues since January.

She is aware she is due for a colonoscopy and is interested in having it done sooner due to potential changes in her husband's insurance coverage. She has both Medicare and private insurance.

[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .

[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Left arm pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Donald Clark is an elderly gentleman presenting with left arm and hand pain that began approximately two weeks ago. The pain started suddenly at night, waking him around 2:00 AM with intense severity (""hurting something awful""). He attempted applying ice, which provided some relief after 2-3 hours, allowing him to return to sleep. He also tried holding his arm down, which did not help. This nocturnal pain occurred for several consecutive nights. He subsequently saw another provider who suspected a pinched nerve and initiated treatment. While the nocturnal pain has improved over the last couple of nights, the pain in his hand persists. He notes that if the pain bothers him at night, it usually carries into the following day. The pain originates in the hand and radiates up the entire arm. He reports associated weakness in his left hand, specifically difficulty gripping. He denies pain with moving his neck, turning his head, or moving his shoulder initially, although during the physical exam, he noted mild strain with neck rotation.

**Past Medical History:** Peripheral neuropathy (in one leg, knee to foot, 1% disability). History of left finger injury (""rarely works"").

**Social History:** Veteran, receives 1% disability for leg neuropathy.

**Review of Systems:**
General: No apparent distress.
HEENT: Reports mild strain with neck rotation during exam. Denies pain with neck movement initially.
Neurologic: Reports weakness in left hand with gripping. Reports peripheral neuropathy in leg.

**Current Medications:**
Gabapentin (dose unknown, taken twice daily per plan)
Eliquis (dose unknown)

**Allergies:** None mentioned.

O:
**Physical Exam:**
Constitutional: Elderly Caucasian gentleman presenting in a wheelchair, no apparent distress.
Neurologic:
Upper Extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's.
Strength: Upper extremities normal throughout biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.
Gait: Not assessed today.
Musculoskeletal:
Cervical Spine: Non-tender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, causing mild lateral neck pain but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

**Diagnostics:**
Cervical X-ray (Date: 06/04/2021): Reveals significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

A:
1.  **Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy.** This is the most likely etiology for the patient's radiating arm and hand pain, particularly given the nocturnal exacerbation and associated hand weakness. The cervical x-ray demonstrates significant degenerative changes (arthritis and disc degeneration), which can lead to nerve root compression. Peripheral neuropathy is considered a possible contributing factor.
2.  **Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc degeneration.** The patient's cervical spine x-ray shows significant degenerative changes. While the patient initially denied neck pain with movement, he reported mild strain with rotation during the exam, consistent with the exam finding of mildly restricted, symmetric cervical rotation causing mild lateral neck pain (without radicular symptoms during exam).

P:
**Left upper extremity neuropathy / Cervical radiculopathy:**
*   **Imaging:** Order a cervical MRI to precisely visualize the nerve roots and identify the exact location and extent of potential compression contributing to the patient's symptoms. This is necessary to guide further intervention.
*   **Procedure:** Tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural steroid injection. The exact level for injection will be determined based on the findings of the cervical MRI. The epidural is intended to deliver focused anti-inflammatory medication to the area of suspected nerve root compression to alleviate symptoms.
*   **Medication:** Continue Gabapentin twice daily for nerve pain management.
*   **Therapy:** Continue home exercise program.
*   **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment after the MRI and epidural injection to assess symptom relief. Scheduling of the MRI and epidural will be coordinated by staff.

**Neck pain:**
*   Addressed by the plan for imaging and potential injection targeting the underlying degenerative changes contributing to nerve root irritation and potentially local neck discomfort. Continue home exercise program.

**Medication Review:** Patient reports taking Eliquis. Denies taking other blood thinners. This was noted in consideration of the planned injection."

Routine follow up of chronic medical conditions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Eugene Walker is a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions.

Today, the patient reports feeling more fatigued as of late. He notes that he usually rides his bike for about 20 to 30 miles and by the end of his ride he is tired enough that he will immediately fall asleep. The patient adds that he can fall asleep easily and gets about 6 or 7 hours of sleep per night. He believes he snores a bit but denies any signs of apnea.

Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 01/22/2013. As he is now 8 years post-op, he has requested an echocardiogram from Dr. Lewis to review how he is doing currently. His last stress test was performed on 09/09/2019.

Mr. Walker reports that his wife and friends have told him that he has pursed lips when he walks. This has also been noticed by his other providers. He denies any wheezing.

Furthermore, the patient has noticed a 2 to 3 mm nodule in his right testicle, possibly with the epididymis but he is unsure. He has not had a vasectomy.

His current medication list only consists of clindamycin prior to dental procedures and vitamin D3 (50,000 IU on Sundays and 2000 IU the other 6 days).

From a preventative standpoint, the patient is due for the shingles vaccine and an MMR titer. He is fully vaccinated for COVID-19 with his first dose on 01/15/2021 and his second dose on 02/05/2021.

[patient] thank you .
[doctor] did you have any problems finding us ?
[patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before .
[doctor] good . so how can i help you today ? uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea .
[patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .
[doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ?
[patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .
[doctor] i saw that .
[patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .
[doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal .
[patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .
[doctor] is the pain there all the time ?
[patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .
[doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ?
[patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .
[doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ?
[patient] they were normal .
[doctor] uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ?
[patient] probably more constipation .
[doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ?
[patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .
[doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ?
[patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .
[doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ?
[patient] yeah , it gets a little better .
[doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?
[patient] none of that .
[doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?
[patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .
[doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ?
[patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .
[doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?
[patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .
[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?
[patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .
[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ?
[patient] i've never had any surgery .
[doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ?
[patient] yup .
[doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?
[patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .
[doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .
[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?
[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .
[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .
[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?
[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .
[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?
[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .
[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?
[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .
[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?
[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .
[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?
[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .
[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?
[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .
[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .
[patient] what would cause that ?
[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .
[patient] that's good .
[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .
[patient] what's that ?
[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .
[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?
[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .
[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?
[doctor] correct .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .
[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?
[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .
[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?
[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .
[patient] so what do i need to do ?
[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .
[patient] okay . and then what ?
[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .
[patient] which medications ?
[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?
[patient] about 18 months .
[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .
[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?
[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .
[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .
[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .
[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?
[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .
[patient] okay . and then what happens ?
[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .
[patient] and when should i see you again ?
[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .
[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?
[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .
[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .
[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .
[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .
[doctor] thank you , mr. allen .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.

Mr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.

In addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Abdomen
Normoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.

RESULTS

CT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.
Impression: Normal CT of abdomen.

ASSESSMENT

• Constipation
• Mild hepatomegaly

PLAN

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.

Constipation
• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.
• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.

Mild Hepatomegaly
• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.
• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.
• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.
• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return to clinic in 4 weeks.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male presenting for a new patient visit to the GI clinic for chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits.
He reports intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately two years, localized just below the umbilicus. He describes the pain as a ""nagging feeling"" when present, which sometimes improves after a bowel movement. He notes the pain has been more frequent in the past couple of months. Approximately four months ago, he presented to the ER for the pain and had a CT scan of the abdomen which was reported as normal.
Over the past two months, he has experienced alternating constipation and diarrhea, stating constipation is more frequent. When constipated, he has bowel movements approximately 3-4 times per week, and the stool is hard. He reports difficulty passing stool and finds that massaging his abdomen sometimes helps. Prior to two months ago, his bowel movements were normal. He experiences episodic diarrhea, which he believes is triggered by certain foods, specifically mentioning pasta with creamy sauce. These episodes are typically single occurrences and then resolve.
He denies blood in his stool, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or indigestion. He reports eating and drinking normally and his weight has been stable, although he desires to lose 25 pounds.

**Past Medical History:** GERD, anxiety, depression.

**Past Surgical History:** Denies any prior surgeries, including abdominal surgeries (gallbladder, appendix intact).

**Family History:** Sister has Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Denies family history of GI cancer or liver disease.

**Social History:** Consumes alcohol (2 beers once a week after yard work). Denies history of heavy alcohol or drug use.

**Review of Systems:**
General: Stable weight. Denies excessive bruising or bleeding. Denies ankle or feet swelling.
GI: (Covered in HPI - abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, no blood, no nausea/vomiting/heartburn/indigestion).
Other: Denies jaundice (observed by clinician). Denies shortness of breath (lungs clear on exam). Denies chest pain, palpitations (heart sounds normal on exam).

**Medications:**
Crestor daily (approx. 18 months)
Olmesartan daily
Tylenol as needed for pain (approx. once a month)

**Allergies:** Not mentioned.

**Colonoscopy History:** Never had a colonoscopy.

O:
**Vitals:** Not mentioned in transcript.
**Physical Exam:**
General: No jaundice noted.
Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs noted.
Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation. Mild hepatomegaly noted on palpation. Increased stool burden felt in the lower colon.
Other: Rest of physical exam noted as normal by clinician.

**Imaging:**
CT Abdomen 01/23/2020: Impression: Normal CT of the abdomen.

**Labs:** Patient reports AST and ALT were slightly elevated on labs approximately four months ago with his primary care physician. No other lab results discussed.

A:
1.  **Chronic Abdominal Pain with Altered Bowel Habits (Constipation predominant, episodic Diarrhea):** Likely functional bowel disorder such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or functional constipation/diarrhea. Patient's history of intermittent mid-abdominal pain, alternating constipation and diarrhea, and improvement of pain with bowel movements are consistent with this. Physical exam reveals increased stool burden in the colon and mild left periumbilical tenderness, supporting constipation as a contributing factor to the pain. Normal abdominal CT scan rules out significant structural pathology. Family history of IBS in sister is noted.
2.  **Mild Hepatomegaly with History of Elevated Liver Enzymes:** Mild hepatomegaly noted on exam today, correlating with patient's report of slightly elevated AST and ALT four months prior. Potential etiologies discussed include medication toxicity (Crestor), alcohol use, fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and other liver diseases. Patient takes Crestor daily and consumes alcohol weekly (2 beers). Further investigation is warranted given the objective finding and reported lab abnormality.

P:
1.  **Chronic Abdominal Pain / Altered Bowel Habits:**
    *   Initiate daily fiber supplement to improve bowel regularity.
    *   Increase daily water intake to at least 48 ounces.
    *   Advise patient to identify and avoid specific food triggers that precipitate diarrhea (e.g., creamy sauces).
2.  **Mild Hepatomegaly / Elevated Liver Enzymes:**
    *   Order repeat liver enzyme panel (AST, ALT, ALP) and other relevant labs today.
    *   Schedule liver ultrasound (pending lab results, aiming within two weeks). Radiology scheduling will contact patient.
    *   Strongly recommend refraining from alcohol consumption.
    *   Advise patient to contact his primary care physician to discuss alternative cholesterol medications, given Crestor is a potential cause of liver enzyme elevation.
3.  **Follow-up:**
    *   Return to clinic in four weeks to discuss response to fiber supplement and review results of repeat labs and liver ultrasound.
    *   Patient instructed to schedule follow-up appointment at checkout and proceed to lab today for blood draw."
virtscribe,D2N029,"[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .
[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .
[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .
[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?
[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .
[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?
[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .
[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?
[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .
[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?
[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .
[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?
[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .
[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?
[patient] mother's .
[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?
[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .
[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?
[patient] i own an auto repair shop .
[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?
[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .
[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?
[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .
[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?
[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .
[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?
[patient] okay , that's fine .
[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .
[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .
[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?
[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .
[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .
[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .
[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .
[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .
[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .
[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .
[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .
[patient] thank you , nice to meet you as well .

Melanoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Jackson is a very pleasant 57-year-old female who presents for a surgical consult for melanoma of the right inferior back. She was referred by her dermatologist who biopsied the 0.7 mm lesion on 04/10 and diagnosed the melanoma. The lesion was initially noticed by the patient’s mother when she was visiting her last month. Mrs. Jackson denies a personal history of atypical nevi and reports that she has annual mole checks by her primary care provider at her physicals. She has never seen a dermatologist prior to last month. There is a family history of melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt. The patient reports that she has been in her usual state of health with no unintentional weight changes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.

Stage: 1.

I reviewed the dermatologist’s photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central amelanotic component and irregular border.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. The biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is a right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency. I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for a wide local excision with a 1-2 cm margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graft closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDE’s of mole surveillance. After discussing the procedure, risks, expected outcomes and possible complications, questions were answered, and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed.","S:

Hematologic/Lymphatic: Denies swollen lymph nodes elsewhere (addressed in HPI regarding physical exam findings).
Skin: See HPI.

**MEDICATIONS:**
None.

**ALLERGIES:**
Augmentin (reaction not specified).

O:
**VITALS:** Not recorded/discussed.

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
General: Pleasant, cooperative female.
Skin: On the right inferior back, there is a 1 cm shave biopsy site including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation. No intrinsic or satellite lesions noted. No other suspicious moles identified on examined areas.
Lymphatic: No axillary, cervical, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy appreciated. A soft, nontender lymph node is palpable in the right groin.
Other systems: Otherwise normal exam (as stated by clinician, specific findings not detailed).

**RESULTS:**
**Pathology Report (Shave biopsy, right inferior back):**
Diagnosis: Malignant melanoma, invasive, superficial spreading.
Histology: Superficial spreading.
Clark level: 4.
Breslow thickness: 0.7 mm.
Radial growth phase: Present.
Vertical growth phase: Not identified.
Mitotic figures: <1/mm².
Ulceration: Not identified.
Regression: Not identified.
Lymphatic invasion: Not identified.
Perineural invasion: Not identified.
Microscopic satellitosis: Not identified.
Infiltrating lymphocytes: Breast (likely typo in dictation, context suggests peritumoral).
Melanocytic nevus: Not identified.
Predominant cytology: Epithelioid.
Peripheral margin: Positive.
Deep margin: Negative.
Stage: 1.

**Dermatologist's Photo Review:** Reviewed photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central amelanotic component and irregular border.

A:
**PROBLEMS:**
1.  Malignant Melanoma, right inferior back (0.7mm Breslow thickness, Clark Level IV, Stage 1, positive peripheral margin).
2.  Right inguinal lymph node, atypical consistency on physical examination.

**ASSESSMENT:**
The patient is a 57-year-old female presenting for surgical consultation following a biopsy confirming malignant melanoma on the right inferior back. The pathology report indicates an invasive, superficial spreading melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 0.7 mm, Clark Level IV, and a positive peripheral margin. This is considered an intermediate thickness melanoma. Pertinent family history includes melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt. Physical examination today revealed a soft, nontender lymph node in the right groin with slightly atypical consistency. Given the potential for rare metastatic spread of melanoma to regional lymph nodes, further evaluation of this finding is warranted.

P:
**PLAN:**
1.  **Malignant Melanoma:**
    *   Discussed the diagnosis, pathology findings (including Breslow thickness, Clark level, margins), and the relationship between tumor histology, prognosis, and treatment options.
    *   Recommended wide local excision of the biopsy site with a 1-2 cm margin, consistent with NCCN guidelines for this thickness.
    *   Discussed expected outcomes, including the likelihood of primary closure but the possibility of needing a skin graft depending on the defect size.
    *   Reviewed potential risks and complications of surgery.
    *   Patient expressed understanding and elected to proceed with the recommended surgical excision.
    *   Procedure to be scheduled.
2.  **Right Inguinal Lymph Node:**
    *   Discussed the finding of the palpable lymph node and the low suspicion for malignancy but the need for further evaluation.
    *   Recommended ultrasound of the right groin to rule out metastatic disease.
    *   Ultrasound to be scheduled. If ultrasound is normal, proceed with wide local excision as planned. If ultrasound is abnormal, further workup may be necessary before definitive surgical planning.
3.  **Follow-up & Prevention:**
    *   Reviewed the importance of long-term follow-up according to NCCN guidelines, emphasizing the increased risk of developing new melanomas.
    *   Stressed the critical need for regular follow-up with her dermatologist for ongoing skin surveillance.
    *   Reinforced principles of sun avoidance, consistent sunscreen use, skin self-examination, and the ABCDEs of mole surveillance.
    *   Patient instructed to return to the surgical clinic if any problems arise or if she desires a follow-up visit after surgery. Otherwise, long-term surveillance will be managed by her dermatologist.
    *   Patient's questions were answered.
    *   Scheduling for ultrasound and wide local excision to be arranged by the nurse."

[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .
[doctor] all right .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Follow-up bilateral breast lumps/cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female presenting for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast lumps.
The patient reports the continued presence of ""lumps"" in both breasts, noting they feel smaller than before but are still present. She experiences some soreness in the left breast, specifically in the area palpated during the exam, which she notes was also sore during past breastfeeding. She expresses worry regarding the lumps due to her mother's history of breast cancer diagnosed at age 45. She is concerned that the lumps have not resolved as expected, despite having had two menstrual cycles since starting progesterone.
She reports significant anxiety in November and December, describing it as ""brutal"" and feeling unable to manage it. This anxiety initially spiked the week before her period but then became more random and seemed to occur for no reason, often starting during the day at work. She attributes this anxiety potentially to work-related stress (supporting COVID evaluation centers/clinics, leading results delivery process), the ""golive"" process in Nov/Dec, possibly aging, and potentially Singulair which she was told could cause anxiety. She was started on Buspar by Dr. Brown and reports her anxiety is now ""going good."" She notes she was on progesterone during the period of severe anxiety in Nov/Dec.
The patient recently discontinued Camila birth control due to a significant increase in appetite (""hunger level was at a new high""). Since stopping, her appetite has normalized, and she reports losing some weight over the past six months.
She continues to use a vaginal cream once a week for itching and discomfort, which she states helps, and she needs a refill.

Not documented/discussed.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
General: Masked face appears thinner (clinician observation).
HEENT: Neck: Small bumps palpated. Swallowing: Perfect.
Lungs: Auscultation not described.
Breast Exam: Bilateral breast density noted on palpation. Lumps felt bilaterally. Tenderness elicited on palpation in the left breast.
Pelvic Exam: Vaginal exam: Appears normal (""looks good"").

LABORATORY/IMAGING DATA:
Not documented/discussed.

A:
1.  Bilateral breast lumps/density: Patient presents for follow-up of known bilateral breast lumps and density, with reported ongoing presence and some soreness. Objective exam confirms bilateral density and palpable lumps, with tenderness in the left breast. Patient expresses concern due to family history of early-onset breast cancer. While benign etiologies (cysts, fibroadenomas) are common, the lack of expected resolution with progesterone and patient's concern warrant further evaluation.
2.  Anxiety: Patient reports significant improvement in previously severe anxiety symptoms since starting Buspar. Symptoms were potentially related to work stress, the pandemic support role, aging, and possibly Singulair or hormonal fluctuations, though symptoms persisted while on progesterone. Currently well-controlled on medication.
3.  History of abnormal Pap smear: Patient has a history of an abnormal Pap smear in 2009 requiring follow-up, with subsequent normal results, including the last Pap in 2019. Given the clinician's concern regarding potential increased risk factors (stress, immunocompromise, COVID/vaccine - *clinician's reasoning*), repeat screening is indicated.
4.  Vaginal itching/discomfort: Patient reports symptoms are well-controlled with weekly use of vaginal cream. Objective exam appears normal. Patient requires a refill of the medication.
5.  Weight change: Patient reports recent weight loss over the past 6 months, correlating with discontinuation of Camila birth control and resolution of increased appetite. Objective exam notes thinner facial appearance. This appears related to medication change and is not currently presented as a problem requiring intervention.

P:
1.  Bilateral breast lumps/density: Continue monitoring. Discussed benign nature of common breast findings (cysts, fibroadenomas) vs. cancer, noting stability is reassuring. Due to patient's concern and family history, referral to a breast specialist will be placed for further evaluation and management. Patient agrees to referral. Specialist can perform in-office ultrasound and potentially expedite procedures if needed.
2.  Anxiety: Continue current management with Buspar as patient reports good control of symptoms. No changes needed at this visit.
3.  History of abnormal Pap smear: Repeat Pap smear today.
4.  Vaginal itching/discomfort: Provide refill for vaginal cream. Continue use once weekly as needed for symptom control.
5.  Weight change: Acknowledge patient's reported weight loss and correlation with medication change. No specific intervention needed at this time.
Follow-up: Breast specialist office will contact patient within the next couple of business days to schedule an appointment. Patient instructed to call the clinic if any new concerns arise."

[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !
[patient] you as well .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Right knee pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a history of diabetes. She has been doing pretty good with her diet. She states that she forgets to check her sugars quite a bit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Some swelling present.
- Palpation: Some pain to palpation on the medial aspect of the right knee, and a little bit of pain on the lateral aspect of the right knee.
- Range of Motion: Limited range of motion as well as pain on both flexion and extension of the knee.
- Special Testing:
McMurray's Test: Negative.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee pain.
- Medical Reasoning: I am concerned about a torn MCL due to pain on ambulation and trouble with weightbearing, as well as the pop she heard.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today including bracing, anti-inflammatories, and icing. - Medical Treatment: I am going to put her in a straight leg brace and I will prescribe some Mobic. She can start taking that as a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down. I want her to ice her knee once an hour for about 15 minutes.
- Additional Testing: I am also going to send her out for an MRI.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient states that her type 2 diabetes are well-managed.
- Medical Treatment: I am also going to get a refill on the metformin that she has been taking 500 mg.
- Additional Testing: We are going to recheck her hemoglobin A1c.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right knee pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient is a female (implied by name Sophia) presenting with right knee pain for 4 days after slipping on a trampoline. She reports feeling a ""little pop"" at the time of injury, followed by significant swelling. She describes the pain as located on the ""inside part"" of her kneecap. She states it is ""really hard to get around"" and hurts ""quite a bit to stand,"" although she is able to put weight on the knee. She has attempted ibuprofen and ice, which provided ""a little bit"" of relief.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Diabetes: Patient reports managing her diet ""pretty good"" but forgets to check her sugars ""quite a bit.""

**Medications:**
*   Metformin 500 mg (frequency not specified)
*   Ibuprofen (OTC, dose/frequency not specified)

**Allergies:**
*   None mentioned.

**Review of Systems:**
*   Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling. Denies other joint pain or swelling.
*   Endocrine: Reports difficulty with consistent blood sugar monitoring.

O:
**Vitals:** Not documented.

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Cardiovascular:** Heart sounds normal, no murmurs or gallops appreciated on auscultation.
*   **Respiratory:** Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
*   **Musculoskeletal:**
    *   **Right Knee:**
        *   Inspection: Swelling present.
        *   Palpation: Pain noted on palpation of the medial aspect of the knee, with less pain on the lateral aspect.
        *   Range of Motion: Limited range of motion with pain on both flexion and extension.
        *   Special Testing: McMurray's test negative.

**Labs/Imaging:** Not yet performed/discussed.

A:
1.  **Right knee pain, suspected Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) injury:** Acute right knee pain following a traumatic event (slipping on trampoline) 4 days ago, associated with a reported ""pop,"" significant swelling, pain on weightbearing, limited range of motion, and pain on palpation of the medial knee. Objective findings of swelling, medial tenderness, and limited painful ROM support a ligamentous injury. The negative McMurray's test makes a significant meniscus tear less likely as the primary injury. Given the mechanism, location of pain, and reported pop, an MCL injury is highly suspected.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Chronic condition requiring ongoing management. Patient reports good dietary adherence but inconsistent blood sugar monitoring. Currently taking Metformin 500mg.

P:
1.  **Right knee pain, suspected MCL injury:**
    *   **Bracing:** Apply straight leg brace for support and to limit motion.
    *   **Medication:** Prescribe Mobic (dose/frequency not specified) for pain relief and to reduce swelling.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Recommend icing the knee once per hour for 15 minutes.
    *   **Imaging:** Order MRI of the right knee to confirm diagnosis and assess for other potential injuries (e.g., meniscus, ACL).
    *   **Patient Education:** Discuss suspected MCL injury, rationale for bracing, medication use, icing, and the need for MRI to fully evaluate the extent of the injury.
2.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Medication:** Refill Metformin 500mg (frequency not specified).
    *   **Labs:** Order recheck of Hemoglobin A1c to assess glycemic control.
    *   **Patient Education:** Briefly reinforce importance of consistent blood sugar monitoring.

**Follow-up:** Follow up after MRI results are available to discuss findings and further management plan."

[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck
[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain
[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder
[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere
[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go
[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well
[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it
[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all
[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently
[doctor] alright
[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers
[doctor] no numbness or tingling
[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater
[doctor] okay
[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro
[doctor] yeah
[patient] acromioclavicular joints
[doctor] yeah yeah
[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch
[doctor] yes thank you yep
[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are
[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder
[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before
[doctor] i have n't
[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan
[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away
[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days
[doctor] okay alright thank you
[patient] bye
[doctor] okay bye","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.

The patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Left shoulder pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Alan Mitchell is a 69-year-old male presenting with left shoulder pain for the past three weeks. The pain began without specific injury, though he notes recent increased activity doing basement renovations, including putting in a new ceiling. He denies any fall or direct hit to the shoulder. He reports the pain has not improved since onset. He is very active and has experienced shoulder pain in the past, which typically resolved with Tylenol.

Current pain is significant with movement, particularly reaching, lifting, and overhead activities, preventing him from putting his hands over his head. The pain is constant and located primarily in the left shoulder, without radiation down the arm. The pain is worse with pressure, affecting his sleep. He denies any associated numbness or tingling in the left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol, which takes the edge off but does not fully relieve the pain. He initially iced the shoulder but has not done so recently. He reports no prior physical therapy for this issue.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Reports pain affecting sleep.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports left shoulder pain, limited movement.
*   **Neurological:** Denies numbness or tingling in the left arm or fingers.

**Medications:** Tylenol (PRN for pain)
**Allergies:** Not discussed in transcript.

O:
**Vitals:** Vitals reviewed, within normal limits.

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Left Shoulder:** Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints.
*   **Left Upper Extremity Neurovascular:** Good hand grip. Capillary refill < 3 seconds. Sensation intact to light touch distally.

**Imaging:**
*   **Left Shoulder X-ray:** Obtained prior to visit. Reviewed today and reported as normal with no fractures or bony abnormalities.

A:
**Left Shoulder Pain:** 69-year-old male presenting with 3 weeks of left shoulder pain, aggravated by movement and overhead activity, affecting sleep. Physical exam reveals limited range of motion and tenderness over the greater tuberosity. X-ray is normal, ruling out fracture or significant bony pathology. Symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy, an injury to the tendons and muscles of the shoulder, based on the clinical presentation and normal X-ray findings.

P:
**Left Shoulder Pain / Likely Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy:**
*   **Imaging:** Order MRI of the left shoulder to further evaluate for rotator cuff pathology and ensure no other issues are present.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Refer to formal physical therapy for approximately 6-8 weeks to strengthen the muscles around the shoulder.
*   **Pain Management:** Continue Tylenol as needed for pain relief.
*   **Future Considerations:** If symptoms do not improve with PT, consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder for potential relief.
*   **Patient Education:** Discussed the likely diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy and the rationale for PT to strengthen muscles. Explained that many patients have successful outcomes with rehab and are able to return to full activity.
*   **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment to review MRI results and discuss further management."

[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies a history of rheumatoid arthritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He works in landscaping. He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.
Neurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.

The patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks.","S:

[patient] no
[doctor] alright is it the inside or outside of your elbows
[patient] inside
[doctor] inside okay let's just do a quick physical exam here i'll take a look at your right elbow first
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] if i bend it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] how about this
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how about the outside
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers
[patient] i think so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay great
[patient] good to go
[doctor] sensation is normal to the touch
[patient] yes
[doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt
[patient] not as much
[doctor] how about this way
[patient] not as much
[doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] same thing on the left
[patient] yes
[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow
[patient] well i have n't been pitching either
[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that
[doctor] i read it in your chart
[patient] man you doctors are good
[doctor] yeah anything else going on today
[patient] just trying to figure out how you're doing
[doctor] very good thank you
[patient] you're welcome
[doctor] nice to see you
[patient] you have a good day","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Pulses are equal in all extremities.
NEURO: Sensation is normal to light touch distally.
MSK: 
Examination of the right elbow: Limited range of motion with extension with pain. Full range of motion with flexion with pain. Pain to palpation along the medial aspect. No pain to palpation on the lateral aspect of the elbow. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.
Examination of the left elbow: minimal pain with flexion and extension Slight Limited ROM on extension of the arm. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the bilateral elbows were obtained and review in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony misalignment.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.","S:

[doctor] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive
[patient] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c
[doctor] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised
[patient] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners
[doctor] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now
[patient] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay
[doctor] thank you
[patient] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot
[doctor] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to
[patient] okay and have you ever smoked before
[doctor] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too
[patient] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well
[doctor] okay
[patient] so do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise
[patient] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family
[doctor] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate
[patient] regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly
[doctor] hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one
[patient] splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound
[doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them
[patient] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay

[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one

[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally

[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

A:
1.  **Uncontrolled Hypertension:** Patient presents with persistently elevated blood pressure (169/74 mmHg in office, reported home readings up to 170/90 mmHg) despite being on a two-drug regimen (Norvasc, Carvedilol) with recent dose adjustments. This is consistent with uncontrolled hypertension. Contributing factors may include diet, alcohol intake, occasional NSAID use, and potential secondary causes given family history of kidney disease and PCP's note on prior bloodwork. Multifactorial etiology is suspected.
2.  **Systolic Ejection Murmur:** Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur noted on cardiac auscultation. Requires further evaluation.
3.  **Bilateral Lower Extremity Edema:** 1+ pitting edema noted bilaterally. Patient reports this occurs with prolonged standing.

P:
1.  **Uncontrolled Hypertension:**
    *   **Medication:** Initiate Cardura 4 mg PO daily. Will discuss plan with PCP.
    *   **Diagnostics:** Order Renal artery ultrasound to rule out renal artery stenosis. Order Morning plasma renin and aldosterone levels and 24-hour urine collection for creatinine, renin, and aldosterone to evaluate for adrenal causes.
    *   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Advise patient to reduce alcohol intake to 1-2 drinks per week. Advise patient to judiciously decrease salt intake.
    *   **Pain Management:** Instruct patient to discontinue NSAIDs (Advil, Motrin, Aleve) due to potential impact on blood pressure and kidneys. Recommend Acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed for pain.
    *   **Referral:** Provide referral to a nutritionist for dietary counseling regarding salt intake and overall healthy eating.
    *   **Monitoring:** Patient instructed to record home blood pressure readings daily for the next 3 weeks, ideally at the same time each day.
    *   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 3 weeks with blood pressure log for re-evaluation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Headache.
- Medical Reasoning: Patient presents with symptoms similar to a tension headache. On exam she has tension and tightness in her paraspinal muscles as well likely due to working at the computer. Additionally, I think her stress level is also a contributing factor.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I discussed the diagnosis with the patient today. I explained that her headaches may be caused by tension around the muscles around her neck and shoulders. I advised her that her symptoms do not appear related to signs of a stroke or brain bleeding. Questions were asked and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue to take Tylenol for the pain. Prescription for Flexeril 5 mg 3 times a day is provided as well.

2. Diabetes mellitus.

**Chief Complaint:** Headache

**History of Present Illness:** Carolyn is a 34-year-old female presenting with headaches that started about a week ago. She describes the pain as dull and located in the back of her head. The headaches come and go, are worse in the evening, and are temporarily relieved by Tylenol or Advil, but return. Associated symptoms include flushing, redness, and heat in her ears, and sometimes dizziness. She reports being under a lot of stress lately, which she feels may be contributing to the headaches. She denies fever, visual changes (wavy lines, spots), and neck or shoulder tightness (though exam later revealed tenderness/tightness). She has had headaches like this before, and this is not the worst headache she has experienced. She denies any history of head trauma or falls.

**Medical History:** Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.

**Social History:** Enjoys golfing. Reports not eating well or exercising in the past week due to stress and headache. Works a lot on the computer and reports not taking breaks every hour.

**Labs/Imaging:** None discussed during the encounter.

A:
1.  **Headache, Tension-type:** This diagnosis is supported by the patient's subjective report of dull pain in the back of the head, association with stress and prolonged computer work, and objective findings of mild posterior paraspinal and bilateral trapezius muscular tenderness and tightness. More serious etiologies such as stroke or intracranial bleeding are considered less likely based on the patient's presentation and the absence of concerning signs/symptoms discussed.
2.  **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, poorly controlled (by patient report):** Patient reports not checking blood sugars recently and decreased adherence to diet and exercise over the past week due to stress and headache. Currently managed with Metformin 500 mg BID.

P:
1.  **Headache, Tension-type:**
    - Continue OTC Tylenol for pain as needed.
    - Prescribe Flexeril 5 mg TID as a mild muscle relaxant to help with neck muscle tension.
    - Patient Education: Discussed likely diagnosis of tension headache related to stress, computer work, and muscle tension. Reassured patient that symptoms do not appear related to stroke or brain bleeding. Encouraged taking breaks from computer work.
    - Follow-up/Precautions: Advised patient to call if headaches become more severe, suddenly worsen, or if fever develops. If headaches are not improved within a few days on Flexeril, patient should call to schedule an earlier appointment (later this week or early next week).
2.  **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:**
    - Continue Metformin 500 mg BID.
    - Order Hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and Chem-12.

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","S:

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.","S:

[doctor] okay
[patient] it takes the edge off
[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying
[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain
[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office
[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile

She is unsure of the exact onset and denies any specific injury or event triggering the pain. The pain is described as a deep, achy sensation located behind both kneecaps. It is aggravated by standing up after prolonged sitting (such as working from home at her desk) and by going up and down stairs. The pain tends to improve after initial movement or with rest. She has tried over-the-counter pain relievers including ibuprofen, Aleve, and Tylenol, which help ""take the edge off"" but do not completely eliminate the pain. The pain significantly impacts her activity level; she is an avid runner who typically runs 5-6 miles daily but is now limited to less than half a mile due to the pain. She reports never being truly pain-free unless completely at rest. She denies any associated redness or swelling in her knees. She denies any prior knee injuries or broken bones.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None mentioned.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None mentioned.
FAMILY HISTORY: None mentioned.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an avid runner, typically running 5-6 miles per day. She works from home, which involves significant desk sitting.

MEDICATIONS:
- Ibuprofen (OTC, PRN for pain)
- Aleve (OTC, PRN for pain)
- Tylenol (OTC, PRN for pain)
(Doses and frequencies not specified in transcript)

ALLERGIES: None mentioned.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral knee pain. Denies knee swelling.
Skin: Denies redness.
(All other systems not explicitly reviewed in transcript)

O:
VITALS:
BP: 120/70 mmHg
HR: 60 bpm
RR: 14

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
General: Normal gait observed.
Cardiovascular: Heart rate regular and slower. No murmurs appreciated on auscultation.
Musculoskeletal:
- Lower Extremity Strength: 3/5 abduction bilaterally, 5/5 remainder of bilateral lower extremities.
- Bilateral Knees: No erythema, ecchymosis, or warmth. No effusion. Tenderness to palpation. Positive patellar grind test bilaterally. Lachman, anterior and posterior drawer, and McMurray tests are negative bilaterally.
Neurological: Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical bilaterally.

IMAGING:
Bilateral knee X-rays reviewed: No fractures or osteoarthritis.
Previous MRI reviewed (details not discussed).

A:
1. Patellofemoral pain syndrome, bilateral.
- This diagnosis is consistent with the patient's subjective report of 6 months of deep, achy pain behind the kneecaps, aggravated by sitting-to-standing and stairs, limiting her running activity. Objective findings supporting this include tenderness to palpation around the patella and a positive patellar grind test. Review of bilateral knee X-rays ruled out fracture and significant osteoarthritis. This condition is common in active individuals and relates to the tracking of the patella.

P:
1. Patellofemoral pain syndrome, bilateral:
- Medications: Continue over-the-counter NSAIDs (ibuprofen, Aleve) or Tylenol as needed for pain relief.
- Therapy: Refer to Physical Therapy for lower extremity strengthening exercises, mobility improvement, and correction of running mechanics.
- Activity: Advised patient to take it easy with running for now. Goal is to gradually return to running as pain improves with therapy.
- Education: Discussed the nature of patellofemoral pain syndrome, its likely cause related to patellar tracking, and the importance of physical therapy and activity modification for recovery.
- Follow-up: Return as needed or follow up after completing physical therapy."
aci,D2N045,"[doctor] hi abigail how are you today
[patient] hello hi nice to meet you i'm i'm doing okay

[patient] once i'm on my feet all day it starts to ache towards the afternoon
[doctor] okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right
[patient] that feels that feels normal
[doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt

[doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here
[patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside
[doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that
[patient] no uh uh
[doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan
[patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym

[patient] am i gon na die

New patient evaluation of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient was adopted and has no knowledge of any family history.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports unintentional weight loss
Gastrointestinal: Reports abdominal pain and constipation. Denies vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports abnormal vaginal bleeding. Denies urinary issues.
Psychiatric: Reports depression

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: There is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. No rebounding or guarding.

Pelvic
- Examination: There are no external lesions on the labia. The vaginal vault is within normal limits. The cervix is pink without lesions. On bimanual exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. No masses on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and demonstrated a 3 cm left ovarian mass with associated localized lymph node involvement. There is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Ovarian cancer.
- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:

[doctor] okay so right now you're experiencing right leg pain but you have injured your your left leg before is that what i'm hearing
[patient] yeah that's fine
[doctor] alright were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop i actually it was like i had to be held from the field because i could n't put weight on my foot
[doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then
[patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen
[doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen
[patient] this happened about couple days ago
[doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all
[patient] yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out
[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling
[patient] no no numbness
[doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation
[patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot
[doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out
[patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep
[doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah
[patient] that scares me
[doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt
[patient] no uh uh
[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery
[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc
[doctor] i know
[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
[doctor] so it's actually
[patient] have to be in the hospital
[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
[patient] i'm right handed
[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
[patient] i mean
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but
[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there
[patient] i suppose so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] thank you
[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] good
[doctor] thank you
[patient] thank you","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.

The patient has a history of a left leg injury.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK:
Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right foot pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents with right foot pain that began approximately two days ago while playing tennis. She was attempting to volley the ball during a double game when she got in front of another player and fell, landing on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She reports quickly twisting her foot while trying to catch herself. She was unable to continue playing immediately after the injury due to pain and required assistance off the court as she could not put weight on the foot. Since the injury, she has wrapped the foot with an Ace wrap, iced it last night, kept it elevated on a pillow, and taken ibuprofen. Ibuprofen provides some relief but wears off. She denies any numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation in the foot.

**Past Medical History:** History of a left leg injury.

**Imaging:**
Right Foot X-ray (3 views): Reviewed. Reveals subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the first and second metatarsal bases. Presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

A:
**Right foot pain:** Consistent with a Lisfranc fracture, specifically involving the second metatarsal bone near the top of the foot and the Lisfranc joint space, as evidenced by the mechanism of injury, inability to bear weight, physical exam findings (midfoot tenderness, positive piano key test), and radiographic findings (dorsal displacement of 2nd metatarsal base, 3mm separation of 1st/2nd metatarsal bases, bony fragment in joint space).

P:
**Right foot Lisfranc fracture:**
1.  **Surgery:** Recommended surgical intervention (ORIF with plates and screws implied) to properly align bones and prevent complications such as poor alignment/healing, loss of arch, flat foot, and arthritis. Patient expressed apprehension regarding surgery but understood the recommendation.
2.  **Imaging:** Order MRI of the right foot to further assess the fracture and evaluate for associated ligamentous injury.
3.  **Post-operative Care (Discussed):** Day surgery procedure with same-day discharge. Patient will be placed in a cast and use crutches. Non-weight bearing on the right foot for 6-8 weeks post-operatively, followed by gradual return to weight-bearing. Patient will be unable to drive due to injury location and dominance.
4.  **Physical Therapy:** Recommend formal physical therapy after surgery to strengthen muscles and aid recovery for return to activity.
5.  **Risks:** Discussed general risks associated with surgical procedures (bleeding, sensation loss, nerve damage, etc.). Paperwork detailing specific risks will be reviewed by MA.
6.  **Activity:** Patient understands she will be out for the remainder of the current tennis season.
7.  **Follow-up:** Follow up in clinic approximately one week post-operatively. Patient instructed to ask any questions leading up to or after the procedure."

2.  **Hypertension:** Chronic condition currently managed on Norvasc 2.5 mg daily. Home blood pressure monitoring shows readings mostly in the 130s/70-80 range, with occasional systolic readings in the 140s-150s. Today's elevated BP is likely secondary to acute pain. Patient reports difficulty adhering to low-salt diet recommendations.
3.  **Diabetes Mellitus:** Chronic condition currently managed on Metformin 500 mg daily. Patient reports improved home blood sugar readings (low 100s pre-meals) compared to a previous reading of ~300. Patient reports difficulty with dietary adherence.

P:
1.  **Suspected Urolithiasis:**
    *   **Pain Management:** Prescribe Oxycodone 5 mg PO every 6-8 hours as needed for severe pain. Continue Tylenol for breakthrough pain.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Encourage aggressive oral fluid intake to help facilitate stone passage. Provide a urine strainer to attempt to capture the stone for analysis if passed.
    *   **Referral:** Refer to Urology for evaluation of recurrent kidney stones and management, even if the stone passes spontaneously prior to the appointment.
2.  **Hypertension:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Norvasc 2.5 mg daily. No dose adjustment at this time given home readings and likely pain-related elevation today.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue home blood pressure monitoring, aiming for at least three times per week.
    *   **Lifestyle:** Reiterate importance of dietary salt restriction (<2300 mg/day).
3.  **Diabetes Mellitus:**
    *   **Medication:** Continue Metformin 500 mg daily.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue home blood glucose monitoring before meals.
    *   **Lifestyle/Referral:** Reiterate importance of dietary modifications. Provide referral to Nutrition/Dietitian for assistance with dietary planning and adherence.

Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan."

[doctor] okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate
[patient] well when i had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin
[doctor] okay
[patient] not the whole way down but almost to the groin and since then i have n't had any more pain and it's just been right about there
[doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go
[patient] well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup
[doctor] mm-hmm

[doctor] can you repeat that
[patient] i did i have a stroke
[doctor] no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.

VITALS

Vitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Evaluation of kidney stones.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Mason Ward is an 80-year-old male presenting for evaluation of kidney stones, referred by his primary care physician. Approximately one week ago, while moving hay, he experienced a sudden onset of severe pain in his right back. He initially attributed it to muscular strain but developed associated sweating and nausea, prompting him to see his doctor. A CT scan ordered by his PCP revealed a kidney stone. He reports never having kidney stones before, although his father has a history of them. When the pain was present, it radiated almost to his groin. He states the severe pain has since resolved, but he has experienced intermittent, less severe pain since the initial episode. He has been straining his urine as instructed but has not observed any stone fragments. He denies any blood in his urine or urine being darker than usual.

**Past Medical History:** None mentioned related to kidney stones.
**Past Surgical History:** None mentioned.
**Family History:** Father with history of kidney stones.
**Social History:** Not discussed.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Reports sweating and nausea with initial pain episode.
*   **Genitourinary:** Reports straining urine with no visible stone fragments. Denies hematuria or darker urine.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Reports right back pain initially, now resolved except for tenderness on exam.

**Medications:** None mentioned prior to visit.
**Allergies:** None mentioned.

O:
**Vital Signs:** Vital signs are stable. No fever noted. Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. (Specific values not provided in transcript).

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Abdomen:** No tenderness to palpation, no rebound, no guarding.
*   **Flank:** Right costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness present.

**Imaging:**
*   **CT Scan (reviewed):** Reveals a 0.5 cm stone located in the proximal right ureter. No evidence of hydronephrosis is noted.

A:
**Assessment:**
1.  **Right Ureteral Calculus (Kidney Stone):** Patient presents with classic symptoms of sudden onset right flank pain radiating to the groin, associated with nausea and sweating, consistent with ureteral stone passage. Physical exam reveals right CVA tenderness. CT scan confirms a 0.5 cm stone in the proximal right ureter with no evidence of obstructive hydronephrosis. The patient's symptoms have largely resolved since the initial episode, suggesting the stone may be progressing or the pain is intermittent.

P:
**Plan:**
1.  **Right Ureteral Calculus:**
    *   **Supportive Care:** Encourage increased fluid intake to facilitate stone passage. Continue straining urine until stone passes.
    *   **Pain Management:** Prescribe Oxycodone 5 mg by mouth every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. Patient may continue Tylenol for breakthrough pain between Oxycodone doses.
    *   **Labs:** Order basic metabolic panel (BMP), urinalysis (UA), and urine culture (UC) to assess renal function and rule out urinary tract infection, which could complicate stone management and guide potential antibiotic use.
    *   **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 1-2 weeks to assess for stone passage and symptom resolution.
    *   **Future Planning:** If the stone has not passed by the follow-up visit, discuss further treatment options, including lithotripsy (shock wave therapy)."

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.","S:

GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 2 weeks.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right-sided back pain and blood in urine.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents with a ~1-week history of constant right-sided back pain. The pain initially started in the back and has since radiated down to the right lower side. She describes the pain as constant and states ibuprofen has provided only minimal relief. She also reports seeing blood in her urine. She denies pain with urination, vomiting, fever, or chills, but reports feeling slightly nauseated. She was referred by her primary care physician due to concern for a kidney stone. This is her first episode of kidney stones, although her father has a history of them. She admits she has likely not been drinking enough water.

**Past Medical History:** None discussed.
**Past Surgical History:** None discussed.
**Family History:** Father with history of kidney stones.
**Social History:** None discussed.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Denies fever, chills.
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Positive for nausea. Denies vomiting.
*   **Genitourinary:** Positive for hematuria. Denies pain with urination.

**Medications:**
*   Ibuprofen (dose/frequency not specified by patient) - taken for pain, minimal relief.

**Allergies:**
*   None mentioned.

O:
**Vitals:** Vitals assessed and noted as ""good,"" ""no fever,"" ""blood pressure heart rate is fine."" (Specific values not provided in transcript).

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Abdomen/GU:** Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. Right CVA tenderness noted near the flank.

**Imaging:**
*   **CT Scan:** Reviewed. Shows a 0.5 cm stone located in the proximal right ureter. No evidence of hydronephrosis.

**Labs:**
*   BMP, Urinalysis, Urine Culture ordered today. (Results pending).

A:
**Kidney Stone, Right Proximal Ureter (0.5 cm):** Patient presents with classic symptoms of renal colic including right flank/back pain radiating to the lower side, hematuria, and nausea. Physical exam reveals right CVA tenderness and abdominal tenderness. CT scan confirms a 0.5 cm stone in the proximal right ureter without associated hydronephrosis, indicating no current obstruction. This presentation is consistent with an uncomplicated right ureteral stone.

P:
**Kidney Stone:**
*   **Supportive Care:** Advised patient to increase fluid intake significantly (""push fluids,"" ""drink as much as possible"") to help facilitate stone passage.
*   **Pain Management:** Prescribed Ibuprofen 800 mg to be taken as needed for pain.
*   **Monitoring:** Provided a urine strainer and instructed patient to strain all urine to detect stone passage.
*   **Labs:** Ordered BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to assess renal function and rule out associated infection. Discussed potential need for antibiotics depending on urinalysis results.
*   **Follow-up:** Schedule follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks to assess symptoms and stone passage.
*   **Further Treatment Discussion:** Discussed potential need for further intervention such as lithotripsy if symptoms persist after 1-2 weeks, explaining it as a minimally invasive procedure using shock waves to break up the stone."

Right foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Reyes is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He sustained an injury yesterday when he dropped a landscape brick on his right foot while doing yard work. He was able to get up and continue working after the injury. He rates his pain level as an 11 out of 10. The patient also reports numbness in his entire right foot, which has been present for a long time. The patient denies taking any medication for pain.

The patient reports he fractured his right ankle 20 years ago. He received non-operative treatment with casting. He has experienced intermittent soreness and swelling in his right ankle since then.

The patient reports surgical history of his left ankle. He continues to experience soreness and occasional giving way of the left ankle.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of a right ankle fracture 20 years ago.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of left ankle surgery.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.
Neurological: Reports right foot numbness.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk in less than 3 seconds in the right foot. Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Right foot motor and sensation are intact and equal to the contralateral side.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: Bruising on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. I do appreciate associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.

RESULTS

An x-ray of the right foot was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, due to a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I advised him that this procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting and he will be discharged home that same evening. He will then follow up with me 24 hours post procedure, and again 2 weeks later. I explained that he will be placed in a cast and will remain non-weight-bearing for 6 to 8 weeks. He will use crutches while ambulating and we will advance his weight-bearing gradually based on how he tolerates the procedure.

I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right foot to further assess the ligaments. I explained to him that if he has poor bone alignment or ligament healing, this can lead to losing the arch in his foot causing pes planus and developing arthritis. I will send an order to the outpatient MRI facility downstairs for him to obtain the MRI this afternoon.

The patient wishes to think over his options before proceeding with the operation.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right foot pain.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Elijah Reyes is a 45-year-old male presenting today for evaluation of right foot pain. He was referred by his primary care provider. Yesterday, while doing yard work, he dropped a landscape brick on his right foot. He reports the foot was initially sore, but he was able to continue working. Since the injury, the foot has become swollen. He rates his current pain as 11 out of 10. He reports associated numbness of the entire right foot, which he states has been present for a long time, unrelated to the injury. He denies taking any medication for the pain.

**Past Medical History:** Reports a right ankle fracture 20 years ago, treated with casting, resulting in intermittent soreness and swelling.

**Past Surgical History:** Reports surgery on his left ankle, which occasionally feels sore and gives way.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Endorses right foot pain, right ankle soreness and swelling, and left ankle soreness and instability.
*   **Neurological:** Endorses right foot numbness (long-standing).

**Medications:** Patient denies taking any medications.
**Allergies:** Not discussed in transcript.

O:
**Vitals:** Vitals reviewed, within normal limits per clinician statement.

**Physical Exam:**
*   **Right Foot:**
    *   Inspection: Bruising noted on the bottom (plantar) and top (dorsal) aspects of the foot. Associated swelling appreciated.
    *   Palpation: Tenderness to palpation over the midfoot.
    *   Neurovascular: Capillary refill brisk (<3 seconds). Strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse. Motor and sensation intact and equal to the contralateral side.

**Imaging Results:**
*   **Right Foot X-ray:** Reviewed today. Demonstrates dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a 3 millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases. Presence of bony fragments noted.

A:
**Right foot pain due to Lisfranc fracture:** Based on the mechanism of injury, physical exam findings (bruising, swelling, midfoot tenderness), and radiographic evidence (dorsal displacement of 2nd metatarsal base, 3mm separation 1st/2nd metatarsal bases, bony fragments), the patient's pain is attributed to a Lisfranc fracture. This involves the fracture of the second metatarsal bone and the top of the foot where the metatarsals meet the cuboids. The significance of this injury is highlighted, particularly concerning potential ligamentous involvement and the risk of poor outcomes such as loss of the foot arch (pes planus) and development of arthritis if not properly aligned.

P:
**Right foot Lisfranc fracture:**
*   **Imaging:** Order placed for outpatient MRI of the right foot this afternoon to assess for associated ligamentous injuries.
*   **Procedure:** Discussed the need for surgical intervention (ORIF with plates and screws) to ensure proper bone and ligament alignment for the best possible outcome and to prevent long-term complications like flat foot and arthritis. Recommended outpatient surgery for tomorrow, if agreeable.
*   **Post-operative Care (Discussed):** Patient will be placed in a cast and will be non-weight-bearing on the right foot for 6 to 8 weeks, using crutches for ambulation. Ambulation will be advanced gradually based on healing and tolerance.
*   **Follow-up:** Scheduled for 24 hours post-procedure, then again in 2 weeks.
*   **Patient Decision:** Patient wishes to think about the recommended surgical plan before proceeding."

[doctor] yeah well yeah who does n't well okay well hopefully we will get you you know squared away here so you can you know play your soccer and go shopping for dresses with dad so so dad tell me does the karen seem bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens
[patient] no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens
[doctor] okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally
[patient] i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really
[doctor] okay good
[patient] never even though anything was going on
[doctor] okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching
[patient] well no uh it's just her face
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens it seems like it several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and and you know wait a minute i i did make a video so you can see just in case it does n't do it during the visit
[doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome
[patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing
[doctor] yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger
[patient] really i had nobody in our family got anything like that
[doctor] okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills
[patient] no
[doctor] okay coughing headache
[patient] ma'am
[doctor] okay how about any problems with karen's sleep
[patient] nope
[doctor] okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] does that feel the same
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen
[patient] that's great
[doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me
[patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing
[doctor] yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards
[patient] so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing
[doctor] not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay
[patient] alright alright sounds good
[doctor] alright thank you you guys have a good day

- Patient Education and Counseling: Nature of the diagnosis was discussed today with the patient and her father. I advised eye tics are very common in children and as many as 1 in 5 children have a tick during their school years. We discussed tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization. I explained that essentially they are brief, sudden and involuntary motor movements and that we do not have a full understanding of the cause. We also discussed that they typically occur around 5 to 10 years of age and mostly resolve on their own within a year. Dad was advised that treatment is not recommended as they do not appear to be bothering Karen and she continues to do well in school and activities. Additionally, we discussed avoiding drawing attention to the tic as it may cause Karen to feel self-conscious and increase the severity of the tic.
- Medical Treatment: None at this time.

Patient Agreements: The patient's parent understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. 
All questions were answered.","S:
**Chief Complaint:** Right eye twitch.

**History of Present Illness:** 3-year-old female presents with a new right eye twitch, first noticed by her father several weeks ago. The twitch is described as involving the whole side of her face, lasting several seconds. Frequency varies, sometimes occurring several times an hour, other days not until late afternoon, but noticed daily for the last several weeks. Patient reports feeling the twitch and sometimes an urge to move her face, followed by a feeling of relief after the movement. She denies any pain associated with the twitch. Father reports the patient does not seem bothered by the twitch and continues her normal activities (playing, school) when it occurs. No other associated symptoms reported. Father provided a video of the twitch for review.

**Past Medical History:** No significant past medical history reported.
**Past Surgical History:** None reported.
**Family History:** No family history of seizures or Tourette's syndrome reported by father.
**Social History:** Patient is 3 years old. Plays soccer. Reported to be eating well, playing with friends, and engaging in normal activities.

**Review of Systems:**
*   **General:** Denies fever, chills. Reports eating well and normal activity level.
*   **HEENT:** Reports right eye twitch. Denies pain. Denies headache.
*   **Respiratory:** Denies cough.
*   **Neurological:** Reports eye twitch with urge and relief. Denies seizures, sleep disturbances. Denies other body parts twitching.

O:
**Vitals:** Not documented in transcript.
**Physical Exam:**
*   **Neurological:** Patient is awake, alert, and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel toe walking is normal. Cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings. No pronator drift. Sensation is intact. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles.
**Other:** Father provided a video of the right eye twitch for review.

A:
**1. Transient Tic:** 3-year-old female presenting with new onset right facial twitch. Subjective report describes an urge followed by relief, consistent with a tic. Father reports variability in frequency and duration, and that the patient is not bothered and continues normal activities. Objective neurological exam is normal. Based on the clinical presentation, including the patient's subjective experience (urge/relief), the nature of the movement (same part of body involved each time), lack of associated symptoms, normal neurological exam, and review of the video, the twitch is most consistent with a transient motor tic. Seizure is less likely given the characteristics described (urge/relief, same body part involved each time, no loss of consciousness or post-ictal state implied).

P:
**1. Transient Tic:**
*   Diagnosis discussed with patient and father. Explained that eye tics are common in children (up to 1 in 5 during school years), are brief, sudden, involuntary movements, and typically begin between 5-10 years of age. Discussed that the cause is not fully understood but most resolve on their own within a year (transient tics).
*   Educated father on the importance of ignoring the tic, as drawing attention to it can make the child self-conscious and potentially worsen the tic.
*   Reassured father that treatment is not recommended at this time as the tic is not impacting the patient's school or activities and she is otherwise doing well.
*   Advised that if the tic worsens or becomes bothersome, further evaluation and treatment options can be considered.
*   No specific follow-up scheduled; return if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise."
aci,D2N056,"[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on
[doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever
[patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms
[doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot
[patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or
[doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room
[patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for
[doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week
[patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm
[doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay
[patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay
[doctor] no i do n't do that
[patient] okay
[doctor] none of us do
[patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either
[doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick
[patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him
[doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load
[patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings
[doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us
[patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings
[doctor] yeah i'm okay
[patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place
[doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family
[patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies
[doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies
[patient] okay and do you smoke
[doctor] i do n't smoke
[patient] do you live with anybody who does
[doctor] i do not
[patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
[doctor] okay it does
[patient] alright
[doctor] thank you
[patient] okay no problem
[doctor] alright","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Recurrent lung infections.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a farmer. He denies smoking or living with anyone who smokes.

ALLERGIES

Patient denies history of seasonal allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fever.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath and productive cough.

VITALS

Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute.
Pulse oxygenation: 99 percent on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Some fine rales were noted.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No clubbing.

RESULTS

X-ray of the chest was reviewed today and shows some round glass opacities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Recurrent lung infections.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms seem consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He is a farmer and has been moving hay quite frequently recently.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed with the patient. I explained that hypersensitivity pneumonitis could be caused by bacteria and/or mold that is found in the hay. We discussed that when inhaling this, it leads to an allergic reaction in the lungs, which would explain why symptoms occur every time he moves hay. He was advised that it would be best to eliminate his exposure to hay in order to prevent further damage to his lungs, however, if he is unable to do this then it would be recommended that he wear a respirator when working. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: A course of oral steroids were prescribed today to help decrease his lung inflammation. CT of the lungs will also be ordered today to confirm the diagnosis. A pulmonary function test was also ordered to assess the severity of his respiratory impairment.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.","S:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Recurrent lung infections.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a farmer presenting with a history of recurrent lung infections. He reports feeling better now, but last week experienced significant cough with a lot of mucus, shortness of breath, and a low-grade fever. Symptoms began last week and lasted up to a week, self-treating with fluids and Robitussin, which provided some relief. He is concerned about the frequency of these infections, stating they occur seemingly every month or every other month, especially over the past six months, often requiring visits to primary care or urgent care for antibiotics, and one time resulting in an emergency room visit. He notes his symptoms seem to start on days he is unloading hay, which he has been doing more frequently recently to help his brother. He does not wear a mask while unloading hay, nor do his siblings.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Recurrent lower respiratory infections, including episodes diagnosed as pneumonia requiring antibiotics and one ER visit.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient is a farmer. He reports unloading hay more frequently recently. Denies smoking or living with anyone who smokes.

FAMILY HISTORY: Has 10 siblings. Denies family history of seasonal allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: Reports low-grade fever last week.
Respiratory: Reports significant cough with a lot of mucus and shortness of breath last week. Denies wheezing.
Allergies: Denies history of seasonal allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
Robitussin (OTC): Taken as needed for cough (dose, route, frequency not specified).
Oral steroid: Prescribed today (name, dose, route, frequency not specified).

ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies. Denies seasonal allergies.

O:
VITALS:
Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
Pulse Oximetry: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Respiratory: Fine rales noted on lung auscultation. No wheezes appreciated.
Musculoskeletal: No clubbing of fingers appreciated.

IMAGING RESULTS:
Chest X-ray: Reviewed today, shows some round glass opacities.

A:
1. Recurrent lung infections, likely Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (Farmer's Lung).
- Patient presents with a history of frequent lower respiratory symptoms, previously diagnosed as pneumonia, occurring in close temporal association with exposure to hay. Physical exam reveals fine rales, and chest X-ray shows round glass opacities, findings consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This condition, also known as Farmer's Lung in the context of agricultural exposure, is an allergic reaction in the lungs caused by inhaling bacteria and/or mold found in hay. The recurrent nature of his symptoms and their link to hay exposure strongly support this diagnosis over typical bacterial or viral pneumonia.

P:
1. Recurrent lung infections, likely Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (Farmer's Lung):
- Initiate a course of oral steroids to decrease lung inflammation associated with the current flare.
- Order CT scan of the lungs to help confirm the diagnosis.
- Order Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) to assess the severity of respiratory impairment.
- Patient Education: Discussed the diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (Farmer's Lung), explaining it is an allergic reaction in the lungs caused by inhaling bacteria/mold in hay, which explains the recurrence of symptoms with exposure. Advised that the best way to prevent future episodes and further lung damage is to eliminate exposure to hay. If complete avoidance is not possible, strongly recommended wearing a respirator when working with hay.
- Follow-up: Patient understands the plan. Follow-up will be arranged after completion of testing and treatment of the current flare to assess response and long-term management strategies."
aci,D2N057,"[patient] hi good afternoon joseph how are you doing today
[doctor] i'm doing well but my my big toe hurts and it's a little red too but it really hurts okay how long has this been going on i would say you know off and on for about two weeks but last week is is when it really became painful i was at a a trade show convention and i could n't walk the halls i could n't do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there

[patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal
[doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops
[patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started
[doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned
[patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother
[doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot
[patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine
[doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help
[patient] okay
[doctor] alrighty
[patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom
[doctor] yeah ouch
[patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt
[doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down
[patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt
[doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further
[patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt
[doctor] that hurts more yeah
[patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt

[patient] okay
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray
[doctor] okay
[patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan
[doctor] okay
[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back
[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in
[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint
[doctor] oh
[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage
[doctor] oh
[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach
[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach
[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there
[doctor] yeah
[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call
[doctor] okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot
[doctor] okay
[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes
[doctor] is that surgery
[patient] i have to
[doctor] would that be
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint
[patient] yeah that would
[doctor] okay
[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer
[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done
[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks

Right great toe pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joseph Walker is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right great toe pain. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, however it worsened last week. He noticed the pain worsening when he was at a trade show convention and he could not ambulate as he was forced to stand there as the pain was there the whole time. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain usually as throbbing and burning, but notes it occasionally changes to sharp, stabbing pain especially with movement or prolonged ambulation. His symptoms also include redness to the right great toe. The patient states that he has been ambulating on his heel to keep his toe from bending. He reports that his pain is present even with the slightest of pressure, which he notes is worse at night when his sheet is touching his right toe. He adds that he has been taking 2 ibuprofen per day, which does not provide him with relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he likes to bicycle ride.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right great toe pain.
Skin: Reports redness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right great toe reveals 10 degrees of plantar flexion with pain. Pain to palpation of the right great toe, between the big toe and 2nd toe. Palpated a bone spur on the right great toe.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right great toe taken today in office reveals a large bone spur on the anterior aspect of the right great toe joint. There is a loss of cartilage with some arthritis present.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot hallux rigidus.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed hallux rigidus. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of custom orthotics. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam once a day to treat the pain. The patient was instructed to discontinue use and contact the office if gastrointestinal issues develop. I advised the patient that I want him to continue his regular activities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the orthotics, I will recommend a cortisone injection or surgical intervention.","S:
